<h2>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The name of Th. Ribot has been for many years
well known in America, and his works have gained
wide popularity. The present translation of one
of his more recent works is an attempt to render
available in English what has been received as a
classic exposition of a subject that is often discussed,
but rarely with any attempt to understand
its true nature.</p>

<p>It is quite generally recognized that psychology
has remained in the semi-mythological, semi-scholastic
period longer than most attempts at scientific
formulization. For a long time it has been
the "spook science" <i>per se</i>, and the imagination, now
analyzed by M. Ribot in such a masterly manner,
has been one of the most persistent, apparently real,
though very indefinite, of psychological spooks.
Whereas people have been accustomed to speak of
the imagination as an entity <i>sui generis</i>, as a lofty
something found only in long-haired, wild-eyed
"geniuses," constituting indeed the center of a cult,
our author, Prometheus-like, has brought it down
from the heavens, and has clearly shown that
<i>imagination is a function of mind common to all</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
<i>men in some degree</i>, and that it is shown in as
highly developed form in commercial leaders and
practical inventors as in the most bizarre of romantic
idealists. The only difference is that the manifestation
is not the same.</p>

<p>That this view is not entirely original with M.
Ribot is not to his discredit&mdash;indeed, he does not
claim any originality. We find the view clearly
expressed elsewhere, certainly as early as Aristotle,
that the greatest artist is he who actually embodies
his vision and will in permanent form, preferably
in social institutions. This idea is so clearly enunciated
in the present monograph, which the author
modestly styles an essay, that when the end of the
book is reached but little remains of the great
imagination-ghost, save the one great mystery underlying
all facts of mind.</p>

<p>That the present rendering falls far below the
lucid French of the original, the translator is well
aware; he trusts, however, that the indulgent reader
will take into account the good intent as offsetting
in part, at least, the numerous shortcomings of this
version.</p>

<p>I wish here to express my obligation to those
friends who encouraged me in the congenial task
of translation.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR'S PREFACE</h2>


<p>Contemporary psychology has studied the purely
reproductive imagination with great eagerness and
success. The works on the different image-groups&mdash;visual,
auditory, tactile, motor&mdash;are known to
everyone, and form a collection of inquiries solidly
based on subjective and objective observation, on
pathological facts and laboratory experiments. The
study of the creative or constructive imagination,
on the other hand, has been almost entirely neglected.
It would be easy to show that the best,
most complete, and most recent treatises on psychology
devote to it scarcely a page or two; often,
indeed, do not even mention it. A few articles, a
few brief, scarce monographs, make up the sum of
the past twenty-five years' work on the subject.
The subject does not, however, at all deserve this
indifferent or contemptuous attitude. Its importance
is unquestionable, and even though the study
of the creative imagination has hitherto remained almost
inaccessible to experimentation strictly so-called,
there are yet other objective processes that
permit of our approaching it with some likelihood
of success, and of continuing the work of former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
psychologists, but with methods better adapted to
the requirements of contemporary thought.</p>

<p>The present work is offered to the reader as an
essay or first attempt only. It is not our intention
here to undertake a complete monograph that would
require a thick volume, but only to seek the underlying
conditions of the creative imagination, showing
that it has its beginning and principal source in
the natural tendency of images to become objectified
(or, more simply, in the motor elements inherent
in the image), and then following it in its
development under its manifold forms, whatever
they may be. For I cannot but maintain that, at
present, the psychology of the imagination is concerned
almost wholly with its part in esthetic creation
and in the sciences. We scarcely get beyond
that; its other manifestations have been occasionally
mentioned&mdash;never investigated. Yet invention in
the fine arts and in the sciences is only a special
case, and possibly not the principal one. We hope
to show that in practical life, in mechanical, military,
industrial, and commercial inventions, in religious,
social, and political institutions, the human
mind has expended and made permanent as much
imagination as in all other fields.</p>

<p>The constructive imagination is a faculty that in
the course of ages has undergone a reduction&mdash;or
at least, some profound changes. So, for reasons
indicated later on, the mythic activity has been
taken in this work as the central point of our topic,
as the primitive and typical form out of which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
greater number of the others have arisen. The creative
power is there shown entirely unconfined,
freed from all hindrance, careless of the possible
and the impossible; in a pure state, unadulterated
by the opposing influence of imitation, of ratiocination,
of the knowledge of natural laws and their
uniformity.</p>

<p>In the first or analytical part, we shall try to resolve
the constructive imagination into its constitutive
factors, and study each of them singly.</p>

<p>The second or genetic part will follow the imagination
in its development as a whole from the dimmest
to the most complex forms.</p>

<p>Finally, the third or concrete part, will be no
longer devoted to the imagination, but to imaginative
beings, to the principal types of imagination
that observation shows us.</p>

<p>May, 1900.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been often repeated that one of the principal
conquests of contemporary psychology is the
fact that it has firmly established the place and
importance of movements; that it has especially
through observation and experiment shown the representation
of a movement to be a movement begun,
a movement in the nascent state. Yet those
who have most strenuously insisted on this proposition
have hardly gone beyond the realm of the
passive imagination; they have clung to facts of
pure reproduction. My aim is to extend their
formula, and to show that it explains, in large
measure at least, the origin of the creative imagination.</p>

<p>Let us follow step by step the passage from reproduction
pure and simple to the creative stage, showing
therein the persistence and preponderance of the
motor element in proportion as we rise from mere
repetition to invention.</p>

<p>First of all, do all representations include motor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
elements? Yes, I say, because every perception
presupposes movements to some extent, and representations
are the remnants of past perceptions.
Certain it is that, without our examining the question
in detail, this statement holds good for the
great majority of cases. So far as visual and tactile
images are concerned there is no possible doubt as
to the importance of the motor elements that enter
into their composition. The eye is very poorly endowed
with movements for its office as a higher
sense-organ; but if we take into account its intimate
connection with the vocal organs, so rich in capacity
for motor combinations, we note a kind of compensation.
Smell and taste, secondary in human
psychology, rise to a very high rank indeed among
many animals, and the olfactory apparatus thus obtains
with them a complexity of movements proportionate
to its importance, and one that at times
approaches that of sight. There yet remains the
group of internal sensations that might cause discussion.
Setting aside the fact that the vague impressions
bound up with chemical changes within
the tissues are scarcely factors in representation, we
find that the sensations resulting from changes in
respiration, circulation, and digestion are not lacking
in motor elements. The mere fact that, in
some persons, vomiting, hiccoughs, micturition, etc.,
can be caused by perceptions of sight or of hearing
proves that representations of this character have
a tendency to become translated into acts.</p>

<p>Without emphasizing the matter we may, then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
say that this thesis rests on a weighty mass of facts;
that the motor element of the image tends to cause
it to lose its purely "inner" character, to objectify
it, to externalize it, to project it outside of ourselves.</p>

<p>It should, however, be noted that what has just
been said does not take us beyond the reproductive
imagination&mdash;beyond memory. All these revived
images are <i>repetitions</i>; but the creative imagination
requires something <i>new</i>&mdash;this is its peculiar and essential
mark. In order to grasp the transition from
reproduction to production, from repetition to creation,
it is necessary to consider other, more rare,
and more extraordinary facts, found only among
some favored beings. These facts, known for a
long time, surrounded with some mystery, and attributed
in a vague manner "to the power of the
imagination," have been studied in our own day
with much more system and exactness. For our
purpose we need to recall only a few of them.</p>

<p>Many instances have been reported of tingling
or of pains that may appear in different parts of the
body solely through the effect of the imagination.
Certain people can increase or inhibit the beating of
their hearts at will, i.e., by means of an intense
and persistent representation. The renowned physiologist,
E. F. Weber, possessed this power, and has
described the mechanism of the phenomenon. Still
more remarkable are the cases of vesication produced
in hypnotized subjects by means of suggestion.
Finally, let us recall the persistent story of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the stigmatized individuals, who, from the thirteenth
century down to our own day, have been quite
numerous and present some interesting varieties&mdash;some
having only the mark of the crucifix, others
of the scourging, or of the crown of thorns.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Let
us add the profound changes of the organism, results
of the suggestive therapeutics of contemporaries;
the wonderful effects of the "faith cure," i.e.,
the miracles of all religions in all times and in all
places; and this brief list will suffice to recall certain
creative activities of the human imagination that we
have a tendency to forget.</p>

<p>It is proper to add that the image acts not altogether
in a positive manner. Sometimes it has an
inhibitory power. A vivid representation of a
movement arrested is the beginning of the stoppage
of that movement; it may even end in complete
arrest of the movement. Such are the cases of
"paralysis by ideas" first described by Reynolds,
and later by Charcot and his school under the name
of "psychic paralysis." The patient's inward conviction
that he cannot move a limb renders him
powerless for any movement, and he recovers his
motor power only when the morbid representation
has disappeared.</p>

<p>These and similar facts suggest a few remarks.</p>

<p>First, that we have here creation in the strict
sense of the word, though it be limited to the organism.
What appears is <i>new</i>. Though one may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
strictly maintain that from our own experience we
have a knowledge of formication, rapid and slow
beating of the heart, even though we may not be
able ordinarily to produce them at will, this position
is absolutely untenable when we consider cases of
vesication, stigmata, and other alleged miraculous
phenomena: <i>these are without precedent in the life
of the individual</i>.</p>

<p>Second, in order that these unusual states may
occur, there are required additional elements in the
producing mechanism. At bottom this mechanism
is very obscure. To invoke "the power of the
imagination" is merely to substitute a word where
an explanation is needed. Fortunately, we do not
need to penetrate into the inmost part of this mystery.
It is enough for us to make sure of the
facts, to prove that they have a representation as
the starting point, and to show that the representation
by itself is not enough. What more then is
needed? Let us note first of all that these occurrences
are rare. It is not within the power of everybody
to acquire stigmata or to become cured of a
paralysis pronounced incurable. This happens only
to those having an ardent faith, a strong desire
<i>that it shall come to pass</i>. This is an indispensable
psychic condition. What is concerned in such a
case is not a single state, but a double one: an
image followed by a particular emotional state (desire,
aversion, etc.). In other words, there are two
conditions: In the first are concerned the motor
elements included in the image, the remains of previous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>perceptions; in the second, there are concerned
the foregoing, <i>plus</i> affective states, tendencies that
sum up the individual's energy. It is the latter fact
that explains their power.</p>

<p>To conclude: This group of facts shows us the
existence, beyond images, of another factor, instinctive
or emotional in form, which we shall have
to study later and which will lead us to the ultimate
source of the creative imagination.</p>

<p>I fear that the distance between the facts here
given and the creative imagination proper will seem
to the reader very great indeed. And why so?
First, because the creative activity here has as its
only material the organism, and is not separated
from the creator. Then, too, because these facts
are extremely simple, and the creative imagination,
in the ordinary sense, is extremely complex; here
there is one operating cause, a single representation
more or less complex, while in imaginative creation
we have several co-operating images with combinations,
co&ouml;rdination, arrangement, grouping.
But it must not be forgotten that our present aim
is simply to find <i>a transition stage</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> between reproduction
and production; to show the common origin
of the two forms of imagination&mdash;the purely representative
faculty and the faculty of creating by
means of the intermediation of images;&mdash;and to
show at the same time the work of separation, of
severance between the two.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Since the chief aim of this study is to prove that
the basis of invention must be sought in motor manifestations,
I shall not hesitate to dwell on it, and
I take the subject up again under another, clearer,
more precise, and more psychological form, in putting
the following question: Which one among the
various modes of mind-activity offers the closest
analogy to the creative imagination? I unhesitatingly
answer, <i>voluntary activity</i>: Imagination, in
the intellectual order, is the equivalent of will in the
realm of movements. Let us justify this comparison
by some proof.</p>

<p>1. Likeness of development in the two instances.
Growth of voluntary control is progressive, slow,
crossed and checked. The individual has to become
master of his muscles and by their agency extend
his sway over other things. Reflexes, instinctive
movements, and movements expressive of emotion
constitute the primary material of voluntary movements.
The will has no movements of its own as
an inheritance: it must co&ouml;rdinate and associate,
since it separates in order to form new associations.
It reigns by right of conquest, not by right of birth.
In like manner, the creative imagination does not
rise completely armed. Its raw materials are
images, which here correspond to muscular movements.
It goes through a period of trial. It always
is, at the start (for reasons indicated later on),
an imitation; it attains its complex forms only
through a process of growth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But this first comparison does not go to the
bottom of the matter; there are yet deeper analogies.
First, the completely subjective character of both
instances. The imagination is subjective, personal,
anthropocentric; its movement is from within outwards
toward an objectification. The understanding,
i.e., the intellect in the restricted sense, has
opposite characteristics&mdash;it is objective, impersonal,
receives from outside. For the creative imagination
the inner world is the regulator; there is a preponderance
of the inner over the outer. For the
understanding, the outside world is the regulator;
there is a preponderance of the outer over the inner.
The world of my imagination is <i>my</i> world as opposed
to the world of my understanding, which is
the world of all my fellow creatures. On the other
hand, as regards the will, we might repeat exactly,
word for word, what we have just said of the
imagination. This is unnecessary. Back of both,
then, we have our true cause, whatever may be our
opinion concerning the ultimate nature of causation
and of will.</p>

<p>3. Both imagination and will have a teleological
character, and act only with a view toward an end,
being thus the opposite of the understanding, which,
as such, limits itself to proof. We are always
wanting something, be it worthless or important.
We are always inventing for an end&mdash;whether in
the case of a Napoleon imagining a plan of campaign,
or a cook making up a new dish. In both
instances there is now a simple end attained by immediate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>means, now a complex and distant goal presupposing
subordinate ends which are means in relation
to the final end. In both cases there is a <i>vis a
tergo</i> designated by the vague term "spontaneity,"
which we shall attempt to make clear later, and a
<i>vis a fronte</i>, an attracting movement.</p>

<p>4. Added to this analogy as regards their nature,
there are other, secondary likenesses between the
abortive forms of the creative imagination and the
impotent forms of the will. In its normal and
complete form will culminates in an act; but with
wavering characters and sufferers from abulia deliberation
never ends, or the resolution remains inert,
incapable of realization, of asserting itself in
practice. The creative imagination also, in its complete
form, has a tendency to become objectified, to
assert itself in a work that shall exist not only for
the creator but for everybody. On the contrary,
with dreamers pure and simple, the imagination remains
a vaguely sketched inner affair; it is not embodied
in any esthetic or practical invention. Revery
is the equivalent of weak desires; dreamers are
the abulics of the creative imagination.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to add that the similarity established
here between the will and the imagination is
only partial and has as its aim only to bring to light
the r&ocirc;le of the motor elements. Surely no one will
confuse two aspects of our psychic life that are so
distinct, and it would be foolish to delay in order
to enumerate the differences. The characteristic of
novelty should by itself suffice, since it is the special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and indispensable mark of invention, and for volition
is only accessory: The extraction of a tooth
requires of the patient as much effort the second
time as the first, although it is no longer a novelty.</p>

<p>After these preliminary remarks we must go on
to the analysis of the creative imagination, in order
to understand its nature in so far as that is accessible
with our existing means. It is, indeed, a tertiary
formation in mental life, if we assume a primary
layer (sensations and simple emotions), and
a secondary (images and their associations, certain
elementary logical operations, etc.). Being composite,
it may be decomposed into its constituent elements,
which we shall study under these three headings,
viz., the intellectual factor, the affective or
emotional factor, and the unconscious factor. But
that is not enough; the analysis should be completed
by a synthesis. All imaginative creation, great or
small, is organic, requires a unifying principle: there
is then also a synthetic factor, which it will be necessary
to determine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE INTELLECTUAL FACTOR.</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Considered under its intellectual aspect, that is,
in so far as it borrows its elements from the understanding,
the imagination presupposes two fundamental
operations&mdash;the one, negative and preparatory,
dissociation; the other, positive and constitutive,
association.</p>

<p>Dissociation is the "abstraction" of the older psychologists,
who well understood its importance for
the subject with which we are now concerned.
Nevertheless, the term "dissociation" seems to me
preferable, because it is more comprehensive. It
designates a genus of which the other is a species.
It is a spontaneous operation and of a more radical
nature than the other. Abstraction, strictly so-called,
acts only on isolated states of consciousness;
dissociation acts, further, on series of states of consciousness,
which it sorts out, breaks up, dissolves,
and through this preparatory work makes suitable
for entering into new combinations.</p>

<p>Perception is a synthetic process, but dissociation
(or abstraction) is already present in embryo in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
perception, just because the latter is a complex state.
Everyone perceives after an individual fashion, according
to his constitution and the impression of the
moment. A painter, a sportsman, a dealer, and an
uninterested spectator do not see a given horse in
the same manner: the qualities that interest one are
unnoticed by another.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The image being a simplification of sensory data,
and its nature dependent on that of previous perceptions,
it is inevitable that the work of dissociation
should go on in it. But this is far too mild
a statement. Observation and experiment show us
that in the majority of cases the process grows wonderfully.
In order to follow the progressive development
of this dissolution, we may roughly differentiate
images into three categories&mdash;complete,
incomplete, and schematic&mdash;and study them in
order.</p>

<p>The group of images here termed <i>complete</i> comprises
first, objects repeatedly presented in daily
experience&mdash;my wife's face, my inkstand, the sound
of a church bell or of a neighboring clock, etc. In
this class are also included the images of things that
we have perceived but a few times, but which, for
additional reasons, have remained clean-cut in our
memory. Are these images complete, in the strict
sense of the word? They cannot be; and the contrary
belief is a delusion of consciousness that, however,
disappears when one confronts it with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
reality. The mental image can contain all the qualities
of an object in even less degree than the perception;
the image is the result of selection, varying
with every case. The painter Fromentin, who
was proud that he found after two or three years
"an exact recollection" of things he had barely
noticed on a journey, makes elsewhere, however,
the following confession: "My memory of things,
although very faithful, has never the certainty admissible
as documentary evidence. The weaker it
grows, the more is it changed in becoming the property
of my memory and the more valuable is it for
the work that I intend for it. In proportion as the
exact form becomes altered, another form, partly
real, partly imaginary, which I believe preferable,
takes its place." Note that the person speaking thus
is a painter endowed with an unusual visual memory;
but recent investigations have shown that
among men generally the so-called complete and
exact images undergo change and warping. One
sees the truth of this statement when, after a lapse
of some time, one is placed in the presence of the
original object, so that comparison between the real
object and its image becomes possible.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Let us
note that in this group <i>the image always corresponds</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<i>to certain individual objects</i>; it is not the same with
the other two groups.</p>

<p>The group of <i>incomplete</i> images, according to
the testimony of consciousness itself, comes from
two distinct sources&mdash;first, from perceptions insufficiently
or ill-fixed; and again, from impressions of
like objects which, when too often repeated, end
by becoming confused. The latter case has been
well described by Taine. A man, says he, who,
having gone through an avenue of poplars wants
to picture a poplar; or, having looked into a poultry-yard,
wishes to call up a picture of a hen, experiences
a difficulty&mdash;his different memories rise up.
The experiment becomes a cause of effacement; the
images canceling one another decline to a state of
imperceptible tendencies which their likeness and
unlikeness prevent from predominating. Images
become blunted by their collision just as do bodies
by friction.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This group leads us to that of <i>schematic</i> images,
or those entirely without mark&mdash;the indefinite image
of a rosebush, of a pin, of a cigarette, etc. This is
the greatest degree of impoverishment; the image,
deprived little by little of its own characteristics,
is nothing more than a shadow. It has become that
transitional form between image and pure concept
that we now term "generic image," or one that at
least resembles the latter.</p>

<p>The image, then, is subject to an unending process
of change, of suppression and addition, of dissociation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>and corrosion. This means that it is not a
dead thing; it is not at all like a photographic plate
with which one may reproduce copies indefinitely.
Being dependent on the state of the brain, the image
undergoes change like all living substance,&mdash;it is
subject to gains and losses, especially losses. But
each of the foregoing three classes has its use for
the inventor. They serve as material for different
kinds of imagination&mdash;in their concrete form, for
the mechanic and the artist; in their schematic form,
for the scientist and for others.</p>

<p>Thus far we have seen only a part of the work of
dissociation and, taking it all in all, the smallest
part. We have, seemingly, considered images as
isolated facts, as psychic atoms; but that is a
purely theoretic position. Images are not solitary
in actual life; they form part of a chain, or rather
of a woof or net, since, by reason of their manifold
relations they may radiate in all directions, through
all the senses. Dissociation, then, works also upon
<i>series</i>, cuts them up, mangles them, breaks them,
and reduces them to ruins.</p>

<p>The ideal law of the recurrence of images is that
known since Hamilton's time under the name of
"law of redintegration,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which consists in the passing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>from a part to the whole, each element tending
to reproduce the complete state, each member of a
series the whole of that series. If this law existed
alone, invention would be forever forbidden to us;
we could not emerge from repetition; we should be
condemned to monotony. But there is an opposite
power that frees us&mdash;it is dissociation.</p>

<p>It is very strange that, while psychologists have
for so long a time studied the laws of association,
no one has investigated whether the inverse process,
dissociation, also has not laws of its own. We
can not here attempt such a task, which would be
outside of our province; it will suffice to indicate in
passing two general conditions determining the association
of series.</p>

<p>First, there are the internal or subjective causes.
The revived image of a face, a monument, a landscape,
an occurrence, is, most often, only partial.
It depends on various conditions that revive the
essential part and drop the minor details, and this
"essential" which survives dissociation depends on
subjective causes, the principal ones of which are
at first practical, utilitarian reasons. It is the tendency
already mentioned to ignore what is of no
value, to exclude that from consciousness. Helmholtz
has shown that in the act of seeing, various
details remain unnoticed because they are immaterial
in the concerns of life; and there are many
other like instances. Then, too, emotional reasons
governing the attention orientate it exclusively in
one direction&mdash;these will be studied in the course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of this work. Lastly, there are logical or intellectual
reasons, if we understand by this term the law
of mental inertia or the law of least resistance by
means of which the mind tends toward the simplification
and lightening of its labor.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are external or objective causes
which are variations in experience. When two or
more qualities or events are given as constantly associated
in experience we do not dissociate them.
The uniformity of nature's laws is the great opponent
of dissociation. Many truths (for example,
the existence of the antipodes) are established with
difficulty, because it is necessary to break up closely
knit associations. The oriental king whom Sully
mentions, who had never seen ice, refused to credit
the existence of solid water. A total impression,
the elements of which had never been given us separately
in experience, would be unanalyzable. If
all cold objects were moist, and all moist objects
cold; if all liquids were transparent and all non-liquids
opaque, we should find it difficult to distinguish
cold from moisture and liquidity from
transparency. On his part, James adds further
that what has been associated sometimes with
one thing and sometimes with another tends to
become dissociated from both. This might be
called a law of association by concomitant variations.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In order to thoroughly comprehend the absolute
necessity for dissociation, let us note that total<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
redintegration is <i>per se</i> a hindrance to creation. Examples
are given of people who can easily remember
twenty or thirty pages of a book, but if they want
a particular passage they are unable to pick it out&mdash;they
must begin at the beginning and continue down
to the required place. Excessive ease of retention
thus becomes a serious inconvenience. Besides these
rare cases, we know that ignorant people, those intellectually
limited, give the same invariable story of
every occurrence, in which all the parts&mdash;the important
and the accessory, the useful and the useless&mdash;are
on a dead level. They omit no detail, they cannot
select. Minds of this kind are inapt at invention. In
short, we may say that there are two kinds of memory:
one is completely systematized, e.g., habits,
routine, poetry or prose learned by heart, faultless
musical rendering, etc. The acquisition forms a compact
whole and cannot enter into new combinations.
The other is not systematized; it is composed of
small, more or less coherent groups. This kind of
memory is plastic and capable of becoming combined
in new ways.</p>

<p>We have enumerated the spontaneous, natural
causes of association, omitting the voluntary and
artificial causes, which are but their imitations. As
a result of these various causes, images are taken
to pieces, shattered, broken up, but made all the
readier as materials for the inventor. This is a
process analogous to that which, in geologic time,
produces new strata through the wearing away of
old rocks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Association is one of the big questions of psychology;
but as it does not especially concern our
subject, it will be discussed in strict proportion to
its use here. Nothing is easier than limiting ourselves.
Our task is reducible to a very clear and
very brief question: What are the forms of association
that give rise to new combinations and
under what influences do they arise? All other
forms of association, those that are only repetitions,
should be eliminated. Consequently, this subject
can not be treated in one single effort; it must be
studied, in turn, in its relations to our three factors&mdash;intellectual,
emotional, unconscious.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the expression "association
of ideas" is faulty.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It is not comprehensive
enough, association being active also in
psychic states other than ideas. It seems indicative
rather of mere juxtaposition, whereas associated
states modify one another by the very fact of their
being connected. But, as it has been confirmed by
long usage, it would be difficult to eliminate the
phrase.</p>

<p>On the other hand, psychologists are not at all
agreed as regards the determination of the principal
laws or forms of association. Without taking sides
in the debate, I adopt the most generally accepted
classification, the one most suitable for our subject&mdash;the
one that reduces everything to the two fundamental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>laws of contiguity and resemblance. In
recent years various attempts have been made to
reduce these two laws to one, some reducing resemblance
to contiguity; others, contiguity to resemblance.
Putting aside the ground of this discussion,
which seems to me very useless, and which
perhaps is due to excessive zeal for unity, we must
nevertheless recognize that this discussion is not
without interest for the study of the creative imagination,
because it has well shown that each of the
two fundamental laws has a characteristic mechanism.</p>

<p>Association by contiguity (or continuity), which
Wundt calls external, is simple and homogeneous.
It reproduces the order and connection of things;
it reduces itself to habits contracted by our nervous
system.</p>

<p>Is association by resemblance, which Wundt calls
internal, strictly speaking, an elementary law?
Many doubt it. Without entering into the long
and frequently confused discussions to which this
subject has given rise, we may sum up their results
as follows: In so-called association by resemblance
it is necessary to distinguish three moments&mdash;(a)
That of the presentation; a state <i>A</i> is
given in perception or association-by-contiguity, and
forms the starting point. (b) That of the work of
assimilation; <i>A</i> is recognized as more or less like a
state <i>a</i> previously experienced. (c) As a consequence
of the co&euml;xistence of <i>A</i> and <i>a</i> in consciousness,
they can later be recalled reciprocally, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the two original occurrences <i>A</i> and <i>a</i> have previously
never existed together, and sometimes, indeed,
may not possibly have existed together. It
is evident that the crucial moment is the second, and
that it consists of an act of active assimilation.
Thus James maintains that "it is a relation that the
mind perceives after the fact, just as it may perceive
the relations of superiority, of distance, of
causality, of container and content, of substance and
accident, or of contrast between an object, and
some second object which the associative machinery
calls up."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Association by resemblance presupposes a joint
labor of association and dissociation&mdash;it is an active
form. Consequently it is the principal source of
the material of the creative imagination, as the
sequel of this work will sufficiently show.</p>

<p>After this rather long but necessary preface, we
come to the intellectual factor rightly so termed,
which we have been little by little approaching.
The essential, fundamental element of the creative
imagination in the intellectual sphere is the capacity
of thinking by analogy; that is, by partial and often
accidental resemblance. By analogy we mean an
imperfect kind of resemblance: like is a genus of
which analogue is a species.</p>

<p>Let us examine in some detail the mechanism of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
this mode of thought in order that we may understand
how analogy is, by its very nature, an almost
inexhaustible instrument of creation.</p>

<p>1. Analogy may be based solely on the <i>number of
attributes compared</i>. Let <i>a b c d e f</i> and <i>r s t u d v</i>
be two beings or objects, each letter representing
symbolically one of the constitutive attributes. It
is evident that the analogy between the two is very
weak, since there is only one common element, <i>d</i>.
If the number of the elements common to both increases,
the analogy will grow in the same proportion.
But the agreement represented above is not
infrequent among minds unused to a somewhat severe
discipline. A child sees in the moon and stars
a mother surrounded by her daughters. The aborigines
of Australia called a book "mussel," merely
because it opens and shuts like the valves of a shellfish.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>2. Analogy may have for its basis the <i>quality</i> or
<i>value</i> of the compound attributes. It rests on a
variable element, which oscillates from the essential
to the accidental, from the reality to the appearance.
To the layman, the likeness between cetacians and
fishes are great; to the scientist, slight. Here,
again, numerous agreements are possible, provided
one take no account either of their solidity or their
frailty.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, in minds without power, there occurs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a semi-unconscious operation that we may call a
transfer through the omission of the middle term.
There is analogy between <i>a b c d e</i> and <i>g h a i f</i>
through the common letter <i>a</i>; between <i>g h a i f</i> and
<i>x y f z q</i> through the common letter <i>f</i>; and finally an
analogy becomes established between <i>a b c d e</i> and
<i>x y f z q</i> for no other reason than that of their common
analogy with <i>g h a i f</i>. In the realm of the
affective states, transfers of this sort are not at all
rare.</p>

<p>Analogy, an unstable process, undulating and
multiform, gives rise to the most unforeseen and
novel groupings. Through its pliability, which is
almost unlimited, it produces in equal measure absurd
comparisons and very original inventions.</p>

<p>After these remarks on the mechanism of thinking
by analogy, let us glance at the processes it employs
in its creative work. The problem is, apparently,
inextricable. Analogies are so numerous, so
various, so arbitrary, that we may despair of finding
any regularity whatever in creative work. Despite
this it seems, however, reducible to two principal
types or processes, which are personification, and
transformation or metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Personification is the earlier process. It is radical,
always identical with itself, but transitory.
It goes out from ourselves toward other things.
It consists in attributing life to everything, in supposing
in everything that shows signs of life&mdash;and
even in inanimate objects&mdash;desires, passions, and
acts of will analogous to ours, acting like ourselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
in view of definite ends. This state of mind is
incomprehensible to an adult civilized man; but it
must be admitted, since there are facts without number
that show its existence. We do not need to
cite them&mdash;they are too well known. They fill the
works of ethnologists, of travelers in savage lands,
of books of mythology. Besides, all of us, at the
commencement of our lives, during our earliest
childhood, have passed through this inevitable stage
of universal animism. Works on child-psychology
abound in observations that leave no possible room
for doubt on this point. The child endows everything
with life, and he does so the more in proportion
as he is more imaginative. But this stage,
which among civilized people lasts only a brief
period, remains in the primitive man a permanent
disposition and one that is always active. This
process of personification is the perennial fount
whence have gushed the greater number of myths,
an enormous mass of superstitions, and a large
number of esthetic productions. To sum up in a
word, all things that have been invented <i>ex analogia
hominis</i>.</p>

<p>Transformation or metamorphosis is a general,
permanent process under many forms, proceeding
not from the thinking subject towards objects, but
from one object to another, from one thing to another.
It consists of a transfer through partial
resemblance. This operation rests on two fundamental
bases&mdash;depending at one time on vague resemblances
(a cloud becomes a mountain, or a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
mountain a fantastic animal; the sound of the wind
a plaintive cry, etc.), or again, on a resemblance
with a predominating emotional element: A perception
provokes a feeling, and becomes the mark,
sign, or plastic form thereof (the lion represents
courage; the cat, artifice; the cypress, sorrow; and
so on). All this, doubtless, is erroneous or arbitrary;
but the function of the imagination is to invent,
not to perceive. All know that this process
creates metaphors, allegories, symbols; it should
not, however, be believed on that account that it
remains restricted to the realm of art or of the development
of language. We meet it every moment
in practical life, in mechanical, industrial, commercial,
and scientific invention, and we shall, later,
give a large number of examples in support of this
statement.</p>

<p>Let us note, briefly, that analogy, as an imperfect
form of resemblance&mdash;as was said above, if we assume
among the objects compared a totality of likenesses
and differences in varying proportions&mdash;necessarily
allows all degrees. At one end of the
scale, the comparison is made between valueless or
exaggerated likenesses. At the other end, analogy
is restricted to exact resemblance; it approaches
cognition, strictly so called; for example, in mechanical
and scientific invention. Hence it is not at all
surprising that the imagination is often a substitute
for, and as Goethe expressed it, "a forerunner of,"
reason. Between the creative imagination and rational
investigation there is a community of nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>&mdash;both
presuppose the ability of seizing upon likenesses.
On the other hand, the predominance of the
exact process establishes from the outset a difference
between "thinkers" and imaginative dreamers ("visionaries").<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE EMOTIONAL FACTOR.</h3>


<p>The influence of emotional states on the working
of the imagination is a matter of current observation.
But it has been studied chiefly by moralists,
who most often have criticised or condemned it as
an endless cause of mistakes. The point of view of
the psychologist is altogether different. He does
not need at all to investigate whether emotions and
passions give rise to mental phantoms&mdash;which is an
indisputable fact&mdash;but <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> they arise.
For, the emotional factor yields in importance to
no other; it is the ferment without which no creation
is possible. Let us study it in its principal
forms, although we may not be able at this moment
to exhaust the topic.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>It is necessary to show at the outset that the influence
of the emotional life is unlimited, that it
penetrates the entire field of invention with no restriction
whatever; that this is not a gratuitous assertion,
but is, on the contrary, strictly justified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
by facts, and that we are right in maintaining the
following two propositions:</p>

<p>1. <i>All forms of the creative imagination imply
elements of feeling.</i></p>

<p>This statement has been challenged by authoritative
psychologists, who hold that "emotion is
added to imagination in its esthetic aspect, not in
its mechanical and intellectual form." This is an
error of fact resulting from the confusion, or from
the imperfect analysis, of two distinct cases. In
the case of non-esthetic creation, the r&ocirc;le of the emotional
life is simple; in esthetic creation, the r&ocirc;le of
emotional element is double.</p>

<p>Let us consider invention, first, in its most general
form. The emotional element is the primal, original
factor; for all invention presupposes a want,
a craving, a tendency, an unsatisfied impulse, often
even a state of gestation full of discomfort. Moreover,
it is concomitant, that is, under its form of
pleasure or of pain, of hope, of spite, of anger, etc.,
it accompanies all the phases or turns of creation.
The creator may, haphazard, go through the most
diverse forms of exaltation and depression; may
feel in turn the dejection of repulse and the joy of
success; finally the satisfaction of being freed from
a heavy burden. I challenge anyone to produce
a solitary example of invention wrought out <i>in
abstracto</i>, and free from any factors of feeling.
Human nature does not allow such a miracle.</p>

<p>Now, let us take up the special case of esthetic
creation, and of forms approaching thereto. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
again we find the original emotional element as at
first motor, then attached to various aspects of
creation, as an accompaniment. But, <i>in addition,
affective states become material for the creative activity</i>.
It is a well-known fact, almost a rule, that
the poet, the novelist, the dramatist, and the musician&mdash;often,
indeed, even the sculptor and the
painter&mdash;experience the thoughts and feeling of their
characters, become identified with them. There are,
then, in this second instance, two currents of feeling&mdash;the
one, constituting emotion as material for art,
the other, drawing out creative activity and developing
along with it.</p>

<p>The difference between the two cases that we
have distinguished consists in this and nothing more
than this. The existence of an emotion-content
belonging to esthetic production changes in no way
the psychologic mechanism of invention generally.
Its absence in other forms of imagination does not
at all prevent the necessary existence of affective
elements everywhere and always.</p>

<p>2. <i>All emotional dispositions whatever may influence
the creative imagination.</i></p>

<p>Here, again, I find opponents, notably Oelzelt-Newin,
in his short and substantial monograph on
the imagination.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Adopting the twofold division of
emotions as sthenic and asthenic, or exciting and
depressing, he attributes to the first the exclusive
privilege of influencing creative activity; but though
the author limits his study exclusively to the esthetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
imagination, his thesis, even understood thus, is
untenable. The facts contradict it completely, and
it is easy to demonstrate that all forms of emotion,
without exception, act as leaven for imagination.</p>

<p>No one will deny that fear is the type of asthenic
manifestations. Yet is it not the mother of phantoms,
of numberless superstitions, of altogether irrational
and chimerical religious practices?</p>

<p>Anger, in its exalted, violent form, is rather an
agent of destruction, which seems to contradict my
thesis; but let us pass over the storm, which is
always of short duration, and we find in its place
milder intellectualized forms, which are various
modifications of primitive fury, passing from the
acute to the chronic state: envy, jealousy, enmity,
premeditated vengeance, and so forth. Are not
these dispositions of the mind fertile in artifices,
stratagems, inventions of all kinds? To keep even
to esthetic creation, is it necessary to recall the saying
<i>facit indignatio versum</i>?</p>

<p>It is not necessary to demonstrate the fecundity
of joy. As for love, everyone knows that its work
consists of creating an imaginary being, which is
substituted for the beloved object; then, when the
passion has vanished, the disenchanted lover finds
himself face to face with the bare reality.</p>

<p>Sorrow rightly belongs in the category of depressing
emotions, and yet, it has as great influence on
invention as any other emotion. Do we not know
that melancholy and even profound sorrow has furnished
poets, musicians, painters, and sculptors with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
their most beautiful inspirations? Is there not an
art frankly and deliberately pessimistic? And this
influence is not at all limited to esthetic creation.
Dare we hold that hypochondria and insanity following
upon the delirium of persecution are devoid
of imagination? Their morbid character is, on the
contrary, the well whence strange inventions incessantly
bubble.</p>

<p>Lastly, that complex emotion termed "self-feeling,"
which reduces itself finally to the pleasure of
asserting our power and of feeling its expansion, or
to the pitiable feeling of our shackled, enfeebled
power, leads us directly to the motor elements that
are the fundamental conditions of invention. Above
all, in this personal feeling, there is the satisfaction
of being a causal factor, i.e., a creator, and every
creator has a consciousness of his superiority over
non-creators. However petty his invention, it confers
upon him a superiority over those who have
invented nothing. Although we have been surfeited
with the repeated statement that the characteristic
mark of esthetic creation is "being disinterested," it
must be recognized, as Groos has so truly remarked,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
that the artist does not create out of the simple
pleasure of creating, but in order that he may behold
a mastery over other minds.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Production is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
natural extension of "self-feeling," and the accompanying
pleasure is the pleasure of conquest.</p>

<p>Thus, on condition that we extend "imagination"
to its full sense, without limiting it unduly to
esthetics, there is, among the many forms of the
emotional life, not one that may not stimulate invention.
It remains to see this emotional factor
at work,&mdash;to note how it can give rise to new combinations;
and this brings us to the association of
ideas.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>We have said above that the ideal and theoretic
law of the recurrence of images is that of "total
redintegration," as e.g., recalling all the incidents
of a long voyage in chronological order, with
neither additions nor omissions. But this formula
expresses what ought to be, not what actually occurs.
It supposes man reduced to a state of pure
intelligence, and sheltered from all disturbing influences.
It suits the completely systematized forms
of memory, hardened into routine and habit; but,
outside of these cases, it remains an abstract concept.</p>

<p>To this law of ideal value, there is opposed the
real and practical law that actually obtains in the
revival of images. It is rightly styled the "law of
interest" or the affective law, and may be stated thus:
In every past event the interesting parts alone revive,
or with more intensity than the others. "Interesting"
here means <i>what affects us in some way under</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<i>a pleasing or painful form</i>. Let us note that the
importance of this fact has been pointed out not by
the associationists (a fact especially worth remembering)
but by less systematic writers, strangers to
that school,&mdash;Coleridge, Shadworth Hodgson, and
before them, Schopenhauer. William James calls
it the "ordinary or mixed association."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The "law
of interest" doubtless is less exact than the intellectual
laws of contiguity and resemblance. Nevertheless,
it seems to penetrate all the more in later
reasoning. If, indeed, in the problem of association
we distinguish these three things&mdash;facts, laws,
causes&mdash;the practical law brings us near to causes.</p>

<p>Whatever the truth may be in this matter, the
emotional factor brings about new combinations by
several processes.</p>

<p>There are the ordinary, simple cases, with a natural,
emotional foundation, depending on momentary
dispositions. They exist because of the fact
that representations that have been accompanied
by the same emotional state tend later to become
associated: the emotional resemblance reunites and
links disparate images. This differs from association
by contiguity, which is a repetition of experience,
and from association by resemblance in the
intellectual sense. The states of consciousness become
combined, not because they have been previously
given together, not because we perceive the
agreement of resemblance between them, but because
they have a common <i>emotional</i> note. Joy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sorrow, love, hatred, admiration, ennui, pride,
fatigue, etc., may become a center of attraction that
groups images or events having otherwise no rational
relations between them, but having the same
emotional stamp,&mdash;joyous, melancholy, erotic, etc.
This form of association is very frequent in dreams
and reveries, i.e., in a state of mind in which the
imagination enjoys complete freedom and works
haphazard. We easily see that this influence, active
or latent, of the emotional factor, must cause entirely
unexpected grouping to arise, and offers an almost
unlimited field for novel combinations, the number
of images having a common emotional factor being
very great.</p>

<p>There are unusual and remarkable cases with an
exceptional emotional base. Of such is "colored
hearing." We know that several hypotheses have
been offered in regard to the origin of this phenomenon.
Embryologically, it would seem to be
the result of an incomplete separation between the
sense of sight and that of hearing, and the survival,
it is said, from a distant period of humanity, when
this state must have been the rule; anatomically,
the result of supposed anastamoses between the
cerebral centers for visual and auditory sensations;
physiologically, the result of nervous irradiation;
psychologically, the result of association. This latter
hypothesis seems to account for the greater
number of instances, if not for all; but, as Flournoy
has observed, it is a matter of "affective" imagination.
Two sensations absolutely unlike (for instance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>the color blue and the sound <i>i</i>) may resemble
one another through the equal retentive quality that
they possess in the organism of some favored individuals,
and this emotional factor becomes a bond
of association. Observe that this hypothesis explains
also the much more unusual cases of "colored"
smell, taste, and pain; that is, an abnormal
association between given colors and tastes, smells,
or pains.</p>

<p>Although we meet them only as exceptional
cases, these modes of association are susceptible to
analysis, and seem clear, almost self-evident, if we
compare them with other, subtle, refined, barely perceptible
cases, the origin of which is a subject for
supposition, for guessing rather than for clear comprehension.
It is, moreover, a sort of imagination
belonging to very few people: certain artists and
some eccentric or unbalanced minds, scarcely ever
found outside the esthetic or practical life. I wish
to speak of the forms of invention that permit only
fantastic conceptions, of a strangeness pushed to the
extreme (Hoffman, Poe, Baudelaire, Goya, Wiertz,
etc.), or surprising, extraordinary thoughts, known
of no other men (the symbolists and decadents that
flourish at the present time in various countries of
Europe and America, who believe, rightly or
wrongly, that they are preparing the esthetics of the
future). It must be here admitted that there exists
an altogether special manner of <i>feeling</i>, dependent
on temperament at first, which many cultivate and
refine as though it were a precious rarity. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
lies the true source of their invention. Doubtless,
to assert this pertinently, it would be necessary to
establish the direct relations between their physical
and psychical constitution and that of their work;
to note even the particular states at the moment of
the creative act. To me at least, it seems evident
that the novelty, the strangeness of combinations,
through its deep subjective character, indicates an
emotional rather than an intellectual origin. Let
us merely add that these abnormal manifestations
of the creative imagination belong to the province
of pathology rather than to that of psychology.</p>

<p>Association by contrast is, from its very nature,
vague, arbitrary, indeterminate. It rests, in truth,
on an essentially subjective and fleeting conception,
that of contrariety, which it is almost impossible to
delimit scientifically; for, most often, contraries exist
only by and for us. We know that this form of
association is not primary and irreducible. It is
brought down by some to contiguity, by most others
to resemblance. These two views do not seem to
me irreconcilable. In association by contrast we
may distinguish two layers,&mdash;the one, superficial,
consists of contiguity: all of us have in memory associated
couples, such as large-small, rich-poor, high-low,
right-left, etc., which result from repetition and
habit; the other, deep, is resemblance; <i>contrast exists
only where a common measure between two
terms is possible</i>. As Wundt remarks, a wedding
may be compared to a burial (the union and separation
of a couple), but not to a toothache. There is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
contrast between two colors, contrast between
sounds, but not between a sound and a color, at
least in that there may not be a common basis to
which we may relate them, as in the previously
given instances of "colored" sound. In association
by contrast, there are conscious elements opposed
to one another, and below, an unconscious
element, resemblance,&mdash;not clearly and logically
perceived, but felt&mdash;that evokes and relates the conscious
elements.</p>

<p>Whether this explanation be right or not, let us
remark that association by contrast could not be
left out, because its mechanism, full of unforeseen
possibilities, lends itself easily to novel relations.
Otherwise, I do not at all claim that it is entirely
dependent upon the emotional factor. But, as
H&ouml;ffding observes,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the special property of the emotional
life is moving among contraries; it is altogether
determined by the great opposition between
pleasure and pain. Thus, the effects of contrasts
are much stronger than in the realm of sensation.
This form of association predominates in esthetic
and mythic creation, that is to say, in creation of the
free fancy; it becomes dimmed in the precise forms
of practical, mechanical, and scientific invention.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Hitherto we have considered the emotional factor
under a single aspect only&mdash;the purely emotional&mdash;that
which is manifested in consciousness under an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
agreeable or disagreeable or mixed form. But
thoughts, feelings, and emotions include elements
that are deeper&mdash;motor, i.e., impulsive or inhibitory&mdash;which
we may neglect the less since it is in movements
that we seek the origin of the creative imagination.
This motor element is what current speech
and often even psychological treatises designate
under the terms "creative instinct," "inventive instinct;"
what we express in another form when we
say that creators are guided by instinct and "are
pushed like animals toward the accomplishment of
certain acts."</p>

<p>If I mistake not, this indicates that the "creative
instinct" exists in all men to some extent&mdash;feeble in
some, perceptible in others, brilliant in the great
inventors.</p>

<p>For I do not hesitate to maintain that the creative
instinct, taken in this strict meaning, compared to
animal instinct, is a mere figure of speech, an "entity"
regarded as a reality, an abstraction. There
are needs, appetites, tendencies, desires, common to
all men, which, in a given individual at a given
moment can result in a creative act; but there is no
special psychic manifestation that may be the "creative
instinct." What, indeed, could it be? Every
instinct has its own particular end:&mdash;hunger, thirst,
sex, the specific instincts of the bee, ant, beaver,
consist of a group of movements adapted for a determinate
end that is always the same. Now, what
would be a creative instinct <i>in general</i> which, by
hypothesis, could produce in turn an opera, a machine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>a metaphysical theory, a system of finance,
a plan of military campaign, and so forth? It is a
pure fancy. Inventive genius has not <i>a</i> source, but
<i>sources</i>.</p>

<p>Let us consider from our present viewpoint the
human duality, the <i>homo duplex</i>:</p>

<p>Suppose man reduced to a state of pure intelligence,
that is, capable of perceiving, remembering,
associating, dissociating, reasoning, and nothing
else. All creative activity is then impossible, because
there is nothing to solicit it.</p>

<p>Suppose, again, man reduced to organic manifestations;
he is then no more than a bundle of
wants, appetites, instincts,&mdash;that is, of motor activities,
blind forces that, lacking a sufficient cerebral
organ, will produce nothing.</p>

<p>The co&ouml;peration of both these factors is indispensable:
without the first, nothing begins; without
the second, nothing results. I hold that it is in needs
that we must seek for the primary cause of all inventions;
it is evident that the motor element alone
is insufficient. If the needs are strong, energetic,
they may determine a production, or, if the intellectual
factor is insufficient, may spoil it. Many
want to make discoveries but discover nothing. A
want so common as hunger or thirst suggests to
one some ingenious method of satisfying it; another
remains entirely destitute.</p>

<p>In short, in order that a creative act occur, there
is required, first, a need; then, that it arouse a combination
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>of images; and lastly, that it objectify and
<i>realize</i> itself in an appropriate form.</p>

<p>We shall try later (in the Conclusion) to answer
the question, <i>Why</i> is one imaginative? In passing,
let us put the opposite question, Why is one <i>not</i>
imaginative? One may possess in the mind an inexhaustible
treasure of facts and images and yet
produce nothing: great travelers, for example, who
have seen and heard much, and who draw from their
experiences only a few colorless anecdotes; men
who were partakers in great political events or military
movements, who leave behind only a few dry
and chilly memoirs; prodigies of reading, living
encyclopedias, who remain crushed under the load
of their erudition. On the other hand, there are
people who easily move and act, but are limited,
lacking images and ideas. Their intellectual poverty
condemns them to unproductiveness; nevertheless,
being nearer than the others to the imaginative
type, they bring forth childish or chimerical
productions. So that we may answer the question
asked above: The non-imaginative person is such
from lack of materials or through the absence of resourcefulness.</p>

<p>Without contenting ourselves with these theoretical
remarks, let us rapidly show that it is thus
that these things actually happen. All the work of
the creative imagination may be classed under two
great heads&mdash;esthetic inventions and practical inventions;
on the one hand, what man has brought
to pass in the domain of art, and on the other hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
all else. Though this division may appear strange,
and unjustifiable, it has reason for its being, as we
shall see hereafter.</p>

<p>Let us consider first the class of non-esthetic creations.
Very different in nature, all the products
of this group coincide at one point:&mdash;they are of
practical utility, they are born of a vital need, of one
of the conditions of man's existence. There are
first the inventions "practical" in the narrow sense&mdash;all
that pertains to food, clothing, defense, housing,
etc. Every one of these special needs has stimulated
inventions adapted to a special end. Inventions
in the social and political order answer to the
conditions of collective existence; they arise from
the necessity of maintaining the coherence of the
social aggregate and of defending it against inimical
groups. The work of the imagination whence have
arisen the myths, religious conceptions, and the first
attempts at a scientific explanation may seem at first
disinterested and foreign to practical life. This is
an erroneous supposition. Man, face to face with
the higher powers of nature, the mystery of which
he does not penetrate, has a <i>need</i> of acting upon it;
he tries to conciliate them, even to turn them to his
service by magic rites and operations. <i>His</i> curiosity
is not at all theoretic; he does not aim to know for
the sake of knowing, but in order to act upon the
outside world and to draw profit therefrom. To the
numerous questions that necessity puts to him his
imagination alone responds, because his reason is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
shifting and his scientific knowledge <i>nil</i>. Here,
then, invention again results from urgent needs.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the course of the nineteenth century
and on account of growing civilization all these
creations reach a second moment when their origin
is hidden. Most of our mechanical, industrial and
commercial inventions are not stimulated by the
immediate necessity of living, by an urgent need; it
is not a question of existence but of better existence.
The same holds true of social and political
inventions which arise from the increasing complexity
and the new requirements of the aggregates
forming great states. Lastly, it is certain that primitive
curiosity has partially lost its utilitarian character
in order to become, in some men at least, the
taste for pure research&mdash;theoretical, speculative, disinterested.
But all this in no way affects our thesis,
for it is a well-known elementary psychological law
that upon primitive wants are grafted acquired
wants fully as imperative. The primitive need is
modified, metamorphosed, adapted; there remains of
it, nonetheless, the fundamental activity toward
creation.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the class of esthetic creations.
According to the generally accepted theory which is
too well known for me to stop to explain it, art has
its beginning in a superfluous, bounding activity,
useless as regards the preservation of the individual,
which is shown first in the form of play. Then,
through transformation and complication, play becomes
primitive art, dancing, music, and poetry at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the same time, closely united in an apparently indissoluble
unity. Although the theory of the absolute
inutility of art has met some strong criticism, let us
accept it for the present. Aside from the true or
false character of inutility, the psychological
mechanism remains the same here as in the preceding
cases; we shall only say that in place of a vital
need it is a need of <i>luxury</i> acting, but it acts only
because it is in man.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the inutility of play is far from
proven biologically. Groos, in his two excellent
works on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> has maintained with much
power the opposite view. According to him the
theory of Schiller and Spencer, based on the expenditure
of superfluous activity and the opposite
theory of Lazarus, who reduces play to a relaxation&mdash;that
is, a recuperation of strength&mdash;are but
partial explanations. Play has a positive use. In
man there exist a great number of instincts that
are not yet developed at birth. An incomplete being,
he must have education of his capacities, and
this is obtained through play, <i>which is the exercise
of the natural tendencies of human activities</i>. In
man and in the higher animals plays are a preparation,
a prelude to the active functions of life.
<i>There is no instinct of play in general, but there
are special instincts that are manifested under the
forms of play.</i> If we admit this explanation, which
does not lack potency, the work of the esthetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
imagination itself would be reduced to a biological
necessity, and there would be no reason for making
a separate category of it. Whichever view we may
adopt, it still remains established that any invention
is reducible, directly or indirectly, to a particular,
determinate need, and that to allow man a special
instinct, the definite specific character of which
should be stimulation to creative activity, is a fantastic
notion.</p>

<p>Whence, then, comes this persistent and in some
respects seductive idea that creation is an instinctive
result? Because a happy invention has characteristics
that evidently relate it to instinctive activity
in the strict sense of the word. First, precocity,
of which we shall later give numerous examples,
and which resembles the innateness of instinct.
Again, orientation in a single direction: the
inventor is, so to speak, polarized; he is the slave of
music, of mechanics, of mathematics; often inapt at
everything outside his own particular sphere. We
know the witticism of Madame du Deffant on
Vaucanson, who was so awkward, so insignificant
when he ventured outside of mechanics. "One
should say that this man had manufactured himself."
Finally, the ease with which invention often
(not always) manifests itself makes it resemble
the work of a pre-established mechanism.</p>

<p>But these and similar characteristics may be lacking.
They are necessary for instinct, not for invention.
There are great creators who have been
neither precocious nor confined in a narrow field,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and who have given birth to their inventions painfully,
laboriously. Between the mechanism of instinct
and that of imaginative creation there are
frequently great analogies but not identity of nature.
Every tendency of our organization, useful
or hurtful, may become the beginning of a
creative act. Every invention arises from a particular
need of human nature, acting within its
own sphere and for its own special end.</p>

<p>If now it should be asked why the creative
imagination directs itself preferably in one line
rather than in another&mdash;toward poetry or physics,
trade or mechanics, geometry or painting, strategy
or music, etc.&mdash;we have nothing in answer. It is a
result of the individual organization, the secret of
which we do not possess. In ordinary life we
meet people visibly borne along toward love or good
cheer, toward ambition, riches or good works;
we say that they are "so built," that such is their
character. At bottom the two questions are identical,
and current psychology is not in a position to
solve them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE UNCONSCIOUS FACTOR</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>By this term I designate principally, not exclusively,
what ordinary speech calls "inspiration." In
spite of its mysterious and semi-mythological appearance,
the term indicates a positive fact, one
that is ill-understood in a deep sense, like all that is
near the roots of creation. This concept has its
history, and if it is permissible to apply a very
general formula to a particular case we may say
that it has developed according to the law of the
three states assumed by the positivists.</p>

<p>In the beginning, inspiration is literally ascribed
to the gods&mdash;among the Greeks to Apollo and the
Muses, and in like manner under various polytheistic
religions. Later, the gods become supernatural
spirits, angels, saints, etc. In one way or another
it is always regarded as external and superior
to man. In the beginnings of all inventions&mdash;agriculture,
navigation, medicine, commerce, legislation,
fine arts&mdash;there is a belief in revelation; the
human mind considers itself incapable of having
discovered all that. Creation has arisen, we do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
not know how, in a total ignorance of the processes.</p>

<p>Later on these higher beings become empty formulas,
mere survivals; there remain only the poets
to invoke their aid, through the force of tradition,
without believing in them. But side by side with
these formal survivals there remains a mysterious
ground which is translated by vague expressions
and metaphors, such as "enthusiasm," "poetic
frenzy," "possession by a spirit," "being overcome,"
"having the devil inside one," "the spirit whispers
as it lists," etc. Here we have come out of the supernatural
without, however, attempting a positive
(i.e., a scientific) explanation.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the third stage, we try to sound this
unknown. Psychology sees in it a special manifestation
of the mind, a particular, semi-conscious,
semi-unconscious state which we must now study.</p>

<p>At first sight, and considered in its negative aspect,
inspiration presents a very definite character.
It does not depend on the individual will. As in the
case of sleep or digestion, we may try to call it
forth, encourage it, maintain it; but not always with
success. Inventors, great and small, never cease to
complain over the periods of unproductiveness which
they undergo in spite of themselves. The wiser
among them watch for the moment; the others
attempt to fight against their evil fate and to create
despite nature.</p>

<p>Considered in its positive aspect, inspiration has
two essential marks&mdash;suddenness and impersonality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>(a) It makes a sudden eruption into consciousness,
but one presupposing a latent, frequently long,
labor. It has its analogues among other well-known
psychic states; for example, a passion that is forgotten,
which, after a long period of incubation,
reveals itself through an act; or, better, a sudden
resolve after endless deliberation which did not
seem able to come to a head. Again, there may be
absence of effort and of appearance of preparation.
Beethoven would strike haphazard the keys of a
piano or would listen to the songs of birds. "With
Chopin," says George Sand, "creation was spontaneous,
miraculous; he wrought without foreseeing.
It would come complete, sudden, sublime."
One might pile up like facts in abundance. Sometimes,
indeed, inspiration bursts forth in deep sleep
and awakens the sleeper, and lest we may suppose
this suddenness to be especially characteristic of
artists we see it in all forms of invention. "You
feel a little electric shock striking you in the head,
seizing your heart at the same time&mdash;that is the moment
of genius" (Buffon). "In the course of my
life I have had some happy thoughts," says Du Bois
Reymond, "and I have often noted that they would
come to me involuntarily, and when I was not
thinking of the subject." Claude Bernard has
voiced the same thought more than once.</p>

<p>(b) Impersonality is a deeper character than the
preceding. It reveals a power superior to the conscious
individual, strange to him although acting
through him: a state which many inventors have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
expressed in the words, "I counted for nothing in
that." The best means of recognizing it would be
to write down some observations taken from the
inspired individuals themselves. We do not lack
them, and some have the virtue of good observation.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
But that would lead us too far afield. Let
us only remark that this unconscious impulse acts
variously according to the individual. Some submit
to it painfully, striving against it just like the
ancient pythoness at the time of giving her oracle.
Others, especially in religious inspiration, submit
themselves entirely with pleasure or else sustain it
passively. Still others of a more analytic turn have
noted the concentration of all their faculties and
capacities on a single point. But whatever characteristics
it takes on, remaining impersonal at bottom
and unable to appear in a fully conscious individual,
we must admit, unless we wish to give it a
supernatural origin, that inspiration is derived from
the unconscious activity of the mind. In order to
make sure of its nature it would then be necessary
to make sure first of the nature of the unconscious,
which is one of the enigmas of psychology.</p>

<p>I put aside all the discussions on the subject as
tiresome and useless for our present aim. Indeed,
they reduce themselves to these two principal propositions:
for some the unconscious is a purely
physiological activity, a "cerebration"; for others
it is a gradual diminution of consciousness which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
exists without being bound to me&mdash;i.e., to the principal
consciousness. Both these are full of difficulties
and present almost insurmountable objections.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Let us take the "unconscious" as a fact and let us
limit ourselves to clearing it up, relating inspiration
to mental states that have been judged worthy of
explaining it.</p>

<p>1. Hypermnesia, or exaltation of memory, in
spite of what has been said about it, teaches us
nothing in regard to the nature of inspiration or of
invention in general. It is produced in hypnotism,
mania, the excited period of "circular insanity,"
at the beginning of general paralysis, and especially
under the form known as "the gift of tongues" in
religious epidemics. We find, it is true, some observations
(among others one by Regis of an illiterate
newspaper vender composing pieces of poetry of his
own), indicating that a heightened memory sometimes
accompanies a certain tendency toward invention.
But hypermnesia, pure and simple, consists
of an extraordinary flood of memories totally
lacking that essential mark of creation&mdash;new combinations.
It even appears that in the two instances
there is rather an antagonism since heightened memory
comes near to the ideal law of total redintegration,
which is, as we know, a hindrance to invention.
They are alike only with respect to the great mass
of separable materials, but where the principle of
unity is wanting there can be no creation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Inspiration has often been likened to the state
of excitement preceding intoxication. It is a well-known
fact that many inventors have sought it in
wine, alcoholic liquors, toxic substances like hashish,
opium, ether, etc. It is unnecessary to mention
names. The abundance of ideas, the rapidity of
their flow, the eccentric spurts and caprices, novel
ideas, strengthening of the vital and emotional tone,
that brief state of bounding fancy of which novelists
have given such good descriptions, make evident
to the least observing that under the influence of
intoxication the imagination works to a much
greater extent than ordinarily. Yet how pale that
is compared to the action of the intellectual poisons
above mentioned, especially hashish. The "artificial
paradise" of DeQuincy, Moreau de Tours, Th&eacute;ophile
Gautier, Baudelaire and others have made
known to all an enormous expansion of the imagination
launched into a giddy course without limits
of time and space.</p>

<p>Strictly, these are facts representing only a stimulated,
artificial, temporary inspiration. They do
not take us into its true nature; at the most they
may teach us concerning some of their physiological
conditions. It is not even an inspiration in the
strict sense, but rather a beginning, an embryo, an
outline, analogous to the creations produced in
dreams which are found very incoherent when we
awake. One of the essential conditions of creation,
a principal element&mdash;the directing principle that organizes
and unifies&mdash;is lacking. Under the influence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of alcoholic drinks and of poisonous intoxicants attention
and will always fall into exhaustion.</p>

<p>3. With greater reason it has been sought to explain
inspiration by comparison with certain forms
of somnambulism, and it has been said that "it is
only the lowest degree of the latter state, somnambulism
in a waking state. In inspiration it is as
though a strange personality were speaking to the
author; in somnambulism it is the stranger himself
who talks or holds the pen, who speaks or writes&mdash;in
a word, does the work."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It would thus be the
modified form of a state that is the culmination of
subconscious activity and a state of double personality.
As this last explanatory expression is wonderfully
abused, and is called upon to serve in all
conditions, preciseness is indispensable.</p>

<p>The inspired individual is like an awakened
dreamer&mdash;he lives in his dream. (Of this we might
cite seemingly authentic examples: Shelly, Alfieri,
etc.) Psychologically, this means that there is in
him a double inversion of the normal state.</p>

<p>To begin with, consciousness monopolized by the
number and intensity of its images is closed to the
influences of the outside world, or else receives them
only to make them enter the web of its dream. The
internal life annihilates the external, which is just
the opposite of ordinary life.</p>

<p>Further, the unconscious or subconscious activity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
passes to the first plane, plays the first part, while
preserving its impersonal character.</p>

<p>This much allowed, if we would go further, we
are thrown into increasing difficulties. The existence
of an unconscious working is beyond doubt;
facts in profusion could be given in support of this
obscure elaboration which enters consciousness only
when all is done. But what is the nature of this
work? Is it purely physiological? Is it psychological?
We come to two opposing theses. Theoretically,
we may say that everything goes on in the
realm of the unconscious just as in consciousness,
<i>only without a message to me</i>; that in clear consciousness
the work may be followed up step by
step, while in unconsciousness it proceeds likewise,
but unknown to us. It is evident that all this is
purely hypothetical.</p>

<p>Inspiration resembles a cipher dispatch which the
unconscious activity transmits to the conscious
process, which translates it. Must we admit that
in the deep levels of the unconscious there are
formed only fragmentary combinations and that they
reach complete systematization only in clear consciousness,
or, rather, is the creative labor identical
in both cases? It is difficult to decide. It seems to
be accepted that genius, or at least richness, in invention
depends on the subliminal imagination,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> not on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the other, which is superficial in nature and soon
exhausted. The one is spontaneous, true; the other,
artificial, feigned. "Inspiration" signifies unconscious
imagination, and is only a special case of it.
Conscious imagination is a kind of perfected state.</p>

<p>To sum up, inspiration is the result of an underhand
process existing in men, in some to a very great
degree. The nature of this work being unknown,
we can conclude nothing as to the ultimate nature
of inspiration. On the other hand, we may in a
positive manner fix the value of the phenomenon in
invention, all the more as we are inclined to over-value
it. We should, indeed, note that inspiration
is not a cause but an effect&mdash;more exactly, a moment,
a crisis, a critical stage; it is an <i>index</i>. It
marks either the end of an unconscious elaboration
which may have been very short or very long, or
else the beginning of a conscious elaboration which
will be very short or very long (this is seen especially
in cases of creation suggested by chance).
On the one hand, it never has an absolute beginning;
on the other hand, it never delivers a finished
work; the history of inventions sufficiently proves
this. Furthermore, one may pass beyond it; many
creations long in preparation seem without a crisis,
strictly so called; such as Newton's law of attraction,
Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper," and the
"Mona Lisa." Finally, many have felt themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
really inspired without producing anything of
value.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>What has been said up to this point does not exhaust
the study of the unconscious factor as a source
of new combinations. Its r&ocirc;le can be studied under
a simpler and more limited form. For this purpose
we need to return for the last time to association
of ideas. The final reason for association (outside
of contiguity, in part at least) must be sought in the
temperament, character, individuality of the subject,
often even in the <i>moment</i>; that is, in a passing
influence, hardly perceptible because it is unconscious
or subconscious. These momentary dispositions
in latent form can excite novel relations in two
ways&mdash;through mediate association and through a
special mode of grouping which has recently received
the name "constellation."</p>

<p>1. Mediate association has been well known since
the time of Hamilton, who was the first to determine
its nature and to give a personal example that has
become classic. Loch Lomond recalled to him the
Prussian system of education because, when visiting
the lake, he had met a Prussian officer who conversed
with him on the subject. His general formula
is this: <i>A</i> recalls <i>C</i>, although there is between them
neither contiguity nor resemblance, but because a
middle term, <i>B</i>, which does not enter consciousness,
serves as a transition between <i>A</i> and <i>C</i>. This mode
of association seemed universally accepted when, latterly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>it has been attacked by M&uuml;nsterberg and
others. People have had recourse to experimentation,
which has given results only in slight agreement.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
For my own part, I count myself among
those contemporaries who admit mediate association,
and they are the greater number. Scripture, who
has made a special study of the subject, and who
has been able to note all the intermediate conditions
between almost clear consciousness and the unconscious,
considers the existence of mediate association
as proven. In order to pronounce as an illusion
a fact that is met with so often in daily experience,
and one that has been studied by so many
excellent observers, there is required more than experimental
investigations (the conditions of which
are often artificial and unnatural), some of which,
moreover, conclude for the affirmative.</p>

<p>This form of association is produced, like the
others, now by contiguity, now by resemblance. The
example given by Hamilton belongs to the first type.
In the experiments by Scripture are found some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the second type&mdash;e.g., a red light recalled, through
the vague memory of a flash of strontium light, a
scene of an opera.</p>

<p>It is clear that by its very nature mediate association
can give rise to novel combinations. Contiguity
itself, which is usually only repetition, becomes
the source of unforeseen relations, thanks to
the elimination of the middle term. Nothing, moreover,
proves that there may not sometimes be several
latent intermediate terms. It is possible that <i>A</i>
should call up <i>D</i> through the medium of <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>,
which remain below the threshold of consciousness.
It seems even impossible not to admit this in the
hypothesis of the subconscious, where we see only
the two end links of the chain, without being able to
allow a break of continuity between them.</p>

<p>2. In his determination of the regulating causes
of association of ideas, Ziehen designates one of
these under the name of "constellation," which has
been adopted by some writers. This may be enunciated
thus: The recall of an image, or of a group of
images, is in some cases the result of a sum of
predominant tendencies.</p>

<p>An idea may become the starting point of a host
of associations. The word "Rome" can call up a
hundred. Why is one called up rather than another,
and at such a moment rather than at another?
There are some associations based on contiguity
and on resemblance which one may foresee,
but how about the rest? Here is an idea <i>A</i>; it is
the center of a network; it can radiate in all directions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>&mdash;<i>B,
C, D, E, F, etc.</i> Why does it call up now
<i>B</i>, later <i>F</i>?</p>

<p>It is because every image is comparable to a force,
which may pass from the latent to the active condition,
and in this process may be reinforced or
checked by other images. There are simultaneous
and inhibitory tendencies. <i>B</i> is in a state of tension
and <i>C</i> is not; or it may be that <i>D</i> exerts an arresting
influence on <i>C</i>. Consequently <i>C</i> cannot prevail.
But an hour later conditions have changed and victory
rests with <i>C</i>. This phenomenon rests on a
physiological basis: the existence of several currents
diffusing themselves through the brain and the possibility
of receiving simultaneous excitations.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>A few examples will make plainer this phenomenon
of reinforcement, in consequence of which an
association prevails. Wahle reports that the Gothic
<i>H&ocirc;tel de Ville</i>, near his house, had never suggested
to him the idea of the Doges' Palace at Venice, in
spite of certain architectural likenesses, until a certain
day when this idea broke upon him with much
clearness. He then recalled that two hours before
he had observed a lady wearing a beautiful brooch
in the form of a gondola. Sully rightly remarks
that it is much easier to recall the words of a foreign
language when we return from the country
where it is spoken than when we have lived a long
time in our own, because the tendency toward recollection
is reinforced by the recent experience of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
words heard, spoken, read, and a whole array of
latent dispositions that work in the same direction.</p>

<p>In my opinion we would find the finest examples
of "constellation," regarded as a creative element,
in studying the formation and development of
myths. Everywhere and always man has had for
material scarcely anything save natural phenomena&mdash;the
sky, land, water, stars, storms, wind, seasons,
life, death, etc. On each of these themes he builds
thousands of explanatory stories, which vary from
the grandly imposing to the laughably childish.
Every myth is the work of a human group which
has worked according to the tendencies of its special
genius under the influence of various stages of intellectual
culture. No process is richer in resources,
of freer turn, or more apt to give what every inventor
promises&mdash;the novel and unexpected.</p>

<p>To sum up: The initial element, external or internal,
excites associations that one cannot always
foresee, because of the numerous orientations possible;
an analogous case to that which occurs in the
realm of the will when there are present reasons
for and against, acting and not acting, one direction
or another, now or later&mdash;when the final resolution
cannot be predicted, and often depends on
imperceptible causes.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I anticipate a possible question:
"Does the unconscious factor differ in nature from
the two others (intellectual and emotional)?" The
answer depends on the hypothesis that one holds
as to the nature of the unconscious itself. According
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>to one view it would be especially physiological,
consequently different; according to another, the difference
can exist only <i>in the processes</i>: unconscious
elaboration is reducible to intellectual or emotional
processes the preparatory work of which is slighted,
and which enters consciousness ready made. Consequently,
the unconscious factor would be a special
form of the other two rather than a distinct element
in invention.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE ORGANIC CONDITIONS OF THE IMAGINATION</h3>


<p>Whatever opinion we may hold concerning the
nature of the unconscious, since that form of activity
is related more than any other to the physiological
conditions of the mental life, the present time is
suitable for an exposition of the hypotheses that it
is permissible to express concerning the organic
bases of the imagination. What we may regard as
positive, or even as probable, is very little.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>First, the anatomical conditions. Is there a "seat"
of the imagination? Such is the form of the question
asked for the last twenty years. In that period
of extreme and closely bounded localization men
strained themselves to bind down every psychic
manifestation to a strictly determined point of the
brain. Today the problem presents itself no longer
in this simple way. As at present we incline
toward scattered localization, functional rather than
properly anatomical, and as we often understand
by "center" the synergic action of several centers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
differently grouped according to the individual case,
our question becomes equivalent to: "Are there certain
portions of the brain having an exclusive or preponderating
part in the working of the creative
imagination?" Even in this form the question is
hardly acceptable. Indeed, the imagination is not
a primary and relatively simple function like that
of visual, auditory and other sensations. We have
seen that it is a state of tertiary formation and very
complex. There is required, then, (1) that the elements
constituting imagination be determined in a
rigorous manner, but the foregoing analysis makes
no pretense of being definitive; (2) that each of
these constitutive elements may be strictly related
to its anatomic conditions. It is evident that we
are far from possessing the secret of such a mechanism.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made to put the question
in a more precise and limited form by studying the
brains of men distinguished in different lines. But
this method, in avoiding the difficulty, answers our
question indirectly only. Most often great inventors
possess qualities besides imagination indispensable
for success (Napoleon, James Watt, etc.). How
draw a dividing line so as to assign to the imagination
only its rightful share? In addition, the anatomical
determination is beset with difficulties.</p>

<p>A method flourishing very greatly about the middle
of the nineteenth century consisted of weighing
carefully a large number of brains and drawing various
conclusions as to intellectual superiority or inferiority
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>from a comparison of the weights. We
find on this point numerous documents in the special
works published during the period mentioned. But
this method of weights has given rise to so many
surprises and difficulties in the way of explanation
that it has been quite necessary to give it up, since
we see in it only another element of the problem.</p>

<p>Nowadays we attribute the greatest importance to
the morphology of the brain, to its histological structure,
the marked development of certain regions, the
determination not only of centers but of connections
and associations between centers. On this last
point contemporary anatomists have given themselves
up to eager researches, and, although the
cerebral architecture is not conceived by all in the
same way, it is proper for psychology to note that
all with their "centers" or "associational system"
try to translate into their own language the complex
conditions of mental life. Since we must choose
from among these various anatomical views let us
accept that of Flechsig, one of the most renowned
and one having also the advantage of putting directly
the problem of the organic conditions of the
imagination.</p>

<p>We know that Flechsig relies on the embryological
method&mdash;that is, on the development&mdash;in the
order of time, of nerves and centers. For him
there exist on the one hand sensitive regions (sensory-motor),
occupying about a third of the cortical
surface; on the other hand, association-centers, occupying
the remaining part.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as the sensory centers are concerned, development
occurs in the following order: Organic
sensations (middle of cerebral cortex), smell (base
of the brain and part of the frontal lobes), sight
(occipital lobe), hearing (first temporal). Whence
it results that in a definite part of the brain the body
comes to proper consciousness of its impulses, wants,
appetites, pains, movements, etc., and that this part
develops first&mdash;"knowledge of the body precedes
that of the outside world."</p>

<p>In what concerns the associational centers, Flechsig
supposes three regions: The great posterior center
(parieto-occipito-temporal); another, much
smaller, anterior or frontal; and a middle center, the
smallest of all (the Island of Reil). Comparative
anatomy proves that the associational centers are
more important than those of sensation. Among
the lower mammals they develop as we go up the
scale: "That which makes the psychic man may
be said to be the centers of association that he possesses."
In the new-born child the sensitive centers
are isolated, and, in the absence of connections between
them, the unity of the self cannot be manifested;
there is a plurality of consciousness.</p>

<p>This much admitted, let us return to our special
question, which Flechsig asks in these words: "On
what does genius rest? Is it based on a special
structure in the brain, or rather on special irritability?
that is, according to our present notions, on
chemical factors? We may hold the first opinion
with all possible force. Genius is always united to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a special structure, to a particular organization of
the brain." All parts of this organ do not have the
same value. It has been long admitted that the
frontal part may serve as a measure of intellectual
capacity; but we must allow, contrariwise, that there
are other regions, "principally a center located under
the protuberance at the top of the head, which is
very much developed in all men of genius whose
brains have been studied down to our day. In
Beethoven, and probably also in Bach, the enormous
development of this part of the brain is striking. In
great scientists like Gauss the centers of the posterior
region of the brain and those of the frontal region
are strongly developed. The scientific genius thus
shows proportions of brain-structure other than the
artistic genius."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> There would then be, according
to our author, a preponderance of the frontal and
parietal regions&mdash;the former obtain especially among
artists; the latter among scientists. Already, twenty
years before Flechsig, R&uuml;dinger had noted the extraordinary
development of the parietal convolutions
in eminent men after a study of eighteen brains. All
the convolutions and fissures were so developed,
said he, that the parieto-occipital region had an altogether
peculiar character.</p>

<p>By way of summary we must bear in mind that,
as regards anatomical conditions, even when depending
on the best of sources, we can at present give
only fragmentary, incomplete, hypothetical views.</p>

<p>Let us now go on to the physiology.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>We might have rightly asked whether the physiological
states existing along with the working of
the creative imagination are the cause, effect, or
merely the accompaniment of this activity. Probably
all the three conditions are met with. First,
concomitance is an accomplished fact, and we may
consider it as an organic manifestation parallel to
that of the mind. Again, the employment of artificial
means to excite and maintain the effervescence
of the imagination assigns a causal or antecedent
position to the physiologic conditions. Lastly, the
psychic activity may be initial and productive of
changes in the organism, or, if these already exist,
may augment and prolong them.</p>

<p>The most instructive instances are those indicated
by very clear manifestations and profound modifications
of the bodily condition. Such are the moments
of inspiration or simply those of warmth from work
which arise in the form of sudden impulses.</p>

<p>The general fact of most importance consists of
changes in the blood circulation. Increase of intellectual
activity means an increase of work in the
cortical cells, dependent on a congested, sometimes
a temporarily an&aelig;mic state. Hyper&aelig;mia seems
rather the rule, but we also know that slight an&aelig;mia
increases cortical excitability. "Weak, contracted
pulse; pale, chilly skin; overheated head; brilliant,
sunken, roving eyes," such is the classic, frequently
quoted description of the physiological state during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
creative labor. There are numerous inventors who,
of their own accord, have noted these changes&mdash;irregular
pulse, in the case of Lagrange; congestion
of the head, in Beethoven, who made use of cold
douches to relieve it, etc. This elevation of the vital
tone, this nervous tension, translates itself also into
motor form through movements analogous to reflexes,
without special end, mechanically repeated
and always the same in the same man&mdash;e.g., movement
of the feet, hands, fingers; whittling the table
or the arms of a chair (as in the case of Napoleon
when he was elaborating a plan of campaign), etc.
It is a safety-valve for the excessive flow of nervous
impulse, and it is admitted that this method of expenditure
is not useless for preserving the understanding
in all its clearness. In a word, increase of
the cerebral circulation is the formula covering the
majority of observations on this subject.</p>

<p>Does experimentation, strictly so called, teach us
anything on this point? Numerous and well-known
physiological researches, especially those of Mosso,
show that all intellectual, and, most of all, emotional,
work, produces cerebral congestion; that the brain-volume
increases, and the volume of the peripheral
organs diminishes. But that tells us nothing particularly
about the imagination, which is but a
special case under the rule. Latterly, indeed, it has
been proposed to study inventors by an objective
method through the examination of their several
circulatory, respiratory, digestive apparatus; their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
general and special sensibility; the modes of their
memory and forms of association, their intellectual
processes, etc. But up to this time no conclusion has
been drawn from these individual descriptions that
would allow any generalization. Besides, has an
experiment, in the strict sense of the word, ever
been made at the "psychological moment"? I know
of none. Would it be possible? Let us admit that
by some happy chance the experimenter, using all
his means of investigation, can have the subject
under his hand at the exact moment of inspiration&mdash;of
the sudden, fertile, brief creative impulse&mdash;would
not the experiment itself be a disturbing
cause, so that the result would be <i>ipso facto</i> vitiated,
or at least unconvincing?</p>

<p>There still remains a mass of facts deserving
summary notice&mdash;the oddities of inventors. Were
we to collect only those that may be regarded as
authentic we could make a thick volume. Despite
their anecdotal character these evidences do not
seem to be unworthy of some regard.</p>

<p>It is impossible to enter here upon an enumeration
that would be endless. After having collected for
my own information a large number of these strange
peculiarities, it seems to me that they are reducible
to two categories:</p>

<p>(1) Those inexplicable freaks dependent on the
individual constitution, and more often probably
also on experiences in life the memory of which
has been lost. Schiller, for example, kept rotten
apples in his work desk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The others, more numerous, are easy to explain.
They are physiological means consciously or
unconsciously chosen to aid creative work; they are
auxiliary helpers of the imagination.</p>

<p>The most frequent method consists of artificially
increasing the flow of blood to the brain. Rousseau
would think bare-headed in full sunshine; Bossuet
would work in a cold room with his head wrapped
in furs; others would immerse their feet in ice-cold
water (Gr&eacute;try, Schiller). Very numerous are those
who think "horizontally"&mdash;that is, lying stretched
out and often flattened under their blankets (Milton,
Descartes, Leibniz, Rossini, etc.)</p>

<p>Some require motor excitation; they work only
when walking,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or else prepare for work by physical
exercise (Mozart). For variety's sake, let us note
those who must have the noise of the streets, crowds,
talk, festivities, in order to invent. For others
there must be external pomp and a personal part
in the scene (Machiavelli, Buffon). Guido Reni
would paint only when dressed in magnificent style,
his pupils crowded about him and attending to his
wants in respectful silence.</p>

<p>On the opposite side are those requiring retirement,
silence, contemplation, even shadowy darkness,
like Lamennais. In this class we find especially
scientists and thinkers&mdash;Tycho-Brah&eacute;, who for
twenty-one years scarcely left his observatory; Leibniz,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>who could remain for three days almost motionless
in an armchair.</p>

<p>But most methods are too artificial or too strong
not to become quickly noxious. Every one knows
what they are&mdash;abuse of wine, alcoholic liquors, narcotics,
tobacco, coffee, etc., prolonged periods of
wakefulness, less for increasing the time for work
than to cause a state of hyperesthesia and a morbid
sensibility (Goncourt).</p>

<p>Summing up: The organic bases of the creative
imagination, if there are any specially its own, remain
to be determined. For in all that has been said
we have been concerned only with some conditions
of the general working of the mind&mdash;assimilation
as well as invention. The eccentricities of inventors
studied carefully and in a detailed manner would
finally, perhaps, be most instructive material, because
it would allow us to penetrate into their inmost
individuality. Thus, the physiology of the
imagination quickly becomes pathology. I shall not
dwell on this, having purposely eliminated the morbid
side of our subject. It will, however, be necessary
to return thereto, touching upon it in another
part of this essay.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>There remains a problem, so obscure and enigmatic
that I scarcely venture to approach it, in the
analogy that most languages&mdash;the spontaneous expression
of a common thought&mdash;establish between
physiologic and psychic creation. Is it only a superficial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>likeness, a hasty judgment, a metaphor, or does
it rest on some positive basis? Generally, the various
manifestations of mental activity have as their
precursor an unconscious form from which they
arise. The sensitiveness belonging to living substance,
known by the names heliotropism, chemotropism,
etc., is like a sketch of sensation and of the
reactions following it; organic memory is the basis
and the obliterated form of conscious memory. Reflexes
introduce voluntary activity; appetitions and
hidden tendencies are the forerunners of effective
psychology. Instinct, on several sides, is like an
unconscious and specific trial of reason. Has the
creative power of the human mind also analogous
antecedents, a physiological equivalent?</p>

<p>One metaphysician, Froschammer, who has elevated
the creative imagination to the rank of primary
world-principle, asserts this positively. For him
there is an objective or cosmic imagination working
in nature, producing the innumerable varieties of
vegetable and animal forms; transformed into subjective
imagination it becomes in the human brain
the source of a new form of creation. "The very
same principle causes the living forms to appear&mdash;a
sort of objective image&mdash;and the subjective images,
a kind of living form."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> However ingenious and
attractive this philosophical theory may be, it is
evidently of no positive value for psychology.</p>

<p>Let us stick to experience. Physiology teaches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
that generation is a "prolonged nutrition," a surplus,
as we see so plainly in the lower forms of
agamous generation (budding, division). The
creative imagination likewise presupposes a superabundance
of psychic life that might otherwise spend
itself in another way. Generation in the physical
order is a spontaneous, natural tendency, although
it may be stimulated, successfully or otherwise, by
artificial means. We can say as much of the other.
This list of resemblances it would be easy to prolong.
But all this is insufficient for the establishment
of a thorough identity between the two cases
and the solution of the question.</p>

<p>It is possible to limit it, to put it into more precise
language. Is there a connection between the development
of the generative function and that of the
imagination? Even in this form the question scarcely
permits any but vague answers. In favor of a
connection we may allege:</p>

<p>(1) The well-known influence of puberty on the
imagination of both sexes, expressing itself in day-dreams,
in aspirations toward an unattainable ideal,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
in the genius for invention that love bestows upon
the least favored. Let us recall also the mental
troubles, the psychoses designated by the name
hebephrenia. With adolescence coincides the first
flowering of the fancy which, having emerged from
its swaddling-clothes of childhood, is not yet sophisticated
and rationalized.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of indifference for the general
thesis of the present work to note that this development
of the imagination depends wholly on the
first effervescence of the emotional life. That "influence
of the feelings on the imagination" and of
"the imagination on the feelings" of which the
moralists and the older psychologists speak so often
is a vague formula for expressing this fact&mdash;that
the motor element included in the images is reinforced.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Per contra</i>, the weakening of the generative
power and of the constructive imagination coincide
in old age, which is, in a word, a decay of nutrition,
a progressive atrophy. It is proper not to omit the
influence of castration. According to the theory of
Brown-S&eacute;quard, it produces an abatement of the
nutritive functions through the suppression of an
internal stimulus; and, although its relations to the
imagination have not been especially studied, it is
not rash to admit that it is an arresting cause.</p>

<p>However, the foregoing merely establishes, between
the functions compared, a concomitance in
the general course of their evolution and in their
critical periods; it is insufficient for a conclusion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
There would be needed clear, authentic and sufficiently
numerous observations proving that individuals
bereft of imagination of the creative type
have acquired it suddenly through the sole fact of
their sexual influences, and, inversely, that brilliant
imaginations have faded under the contrary conditions.
We find some of these evidences in Cabanis,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Moreau de Tours and various alienists; they would
seem to be in favor of the affirmative, but some seem
to me not sure enough, others not explicit enough.
Despite my investigations on this point, and inquiry
of competent persons, I do not venture to draw a
definite conclusion. I leave the question open; it
will perhaps tempt another more fortunate investigator.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE PRINCIPLE OF UNITY</h3>


<p>The psychological nature of the imagination
would be very imperfectly known were we limited
to the foregoing analytical study. Indeed, all creation
whatever, great or small, shows an organic
character; it implies a unifying, synthetic principle.
Every one of the three factors&mdash;intellectual, emotional,
unconscious&mdash;works not as an isolated fact
on its own account; they have no worth save
through their union, and no signification save
through their common bearing. This principle of
unity, which all invention demands and requires, is
at one time intellectual in nature, i.e., as a fixed
idea; at another time emotional, i.e., as a fixed emotion
or passion. These terms&mdash;fixed idea, fixed
emotion&mdash;are somewhat absolute and require restrictions
and reservations, which will be made in
what follows.</p>

<p>The distinction between the two is not at all
absolute. Every fixed idea is supported and maintained
by a need, a tendency, a desire; i.e., by an
affective element. For it is idle fancy to believe in
the <i>persistence</i> of an idea which, by hypothesis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
would be a purely intellectual state, cold and dry.
The principle of unity in this form naturally predominates
in certain kinds of creation: in the practical
imagination wherein the end is clear, where
images are direct substitutes for things, where invention
is subjected to strict conditions under penalty
of visible and palpable check; in the scientific
and metaphysical imagination, which works with
concepts and is subject to the laws of rational logic.</p>

<p>Every fixed emotion should realize itself in an
idea or image that gives it body and systematizes it,
without which it remains diffuse; and all affective
states can take on this permanent form which makes
a unified principle of them. The simple emotions
(fear, love, joy, sorrow, etc.), the complex or derived
emotions (religious, esthetic, intellectual
ideas) may equally monopolize consciousness in their
own interests.</p>

<p>We thus see that these two terms&mdash;fixed idea,
fixed emotion&mdash;are almost equivalent, for they both
imply inseparable elements, and serve only to indicate
the preponderance of one or the other element.</p>

<p>This principle of unity, center of attraction and
support of all the working of the creative imagination&mdash;that
is, a subjective principle tending to become
objectified&mdash;is the ideal. In the complete
sense of the word&mdash;not restrained merely to esthetic
creation or made synonymous with perfection as in
ethics&mdash;the ideal is a construction in images that
should become a reality. If we liken imaginative
creation to physiological generation, the ideal is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ovum awaiting fertilization in order to begin its development.</p>

<p>We could, to be more exact, make a distinction
between the synthetic principle and the ideal conception
which is a higher form of it. The fixation of
an end and the discovery of appropriate means are
the necessary and sufficient conditions for all invention.
A creation, whatever it be, that looks only
to present success, can satisfy itself with a unifying
principle that renders it viable and organized,
but we can look higher than the merely necessary
and sufficient.</p>

<p>The ideal is the principle of unity in motion in
its historic evolution; like all development, it advances
or recedes according to the times. Nothing
is less justified than the conception of a fixed archetype
(an undisguised survival of the Platonic
Ideas), illuminating the inventor, who reproduces
it as best he can. The ideal is a nonentity; it arises
in the inventor and through him; its life is a
<i>becoming</i>.</p>

<p>Psychologically, it is a construction in images belonging
to the merely sketched or outlined type.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
It results from a double activity, negative and positive,
or dissociation and association, the first cause
and origin of which is found in a <i>will that it shall
be so</i>; it is the motor tendency of images in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
nascent state engendering the ideal. The inventor
cuts out, suppresses, sifts, according to his temperament,
character, taste, prejudices, sympathies and
antipathies&mdash;in short, his <i>interest</i>. In this separation,
already studied, let us note one important particular.
"We know nothing of the complex psychic
production that may simply be the sum of component
elements and in which they would remain with their
own characters, with no modification. The nature
of the components disappears in order to give birth
to a novel phenomenon that has its own and particular
features. The construction of the ideal is
not a mere grouping of past experiences; in its totality
it has its own individual characteristics, among
which we no more see the composing lines than we
see the components, oxygen and hydrogen, in water.
In no scientific or artistic production, says Wundt,
does the whole appear as made up of its parts, like
a mosaic."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In other words, it is a case of mental
chemistry. The exactness of this expression, which
is due, I believe, to J. Stuart Mill, has been questioned.
Still it answers to positive facts; for example,
in perception, to the phenomena of contrast
and their analogues; juxtaposition or rapid succession
of two different colors, two different sounds,
of tactile, olfactory, gustatory impressions different
in quality, produces a particular state of consciousness,
similar to a combination. Harmony or
discord does not, indeed, exist in each separate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
sound, but only in the relations and sequence of
sounds&mdash;it is a <i>tertium quid</i>. We have heretofore,
in the discussion of association of ideas, very frequently
represented the states of consciousness as
fixed elements that approach one another, cohere,
separate, come together anew, but always unalterable,
like atoms. It is not so at all. Consciousness,
says Titchener, resembles a fresco in which the transition
between colors is made through all kinds of
intermediate stages of light and shade.... The
idea of a pen or of an inkwell is not a stable thing
clearly pictured like the pen or inkwell itself. More
than any one else, William James has insisted on
this point in his theory of "fringes" of states of
consciousness. Outside of the given instances we
could find many others among the various manifestations
of the mental life. It is not, then, at all
chimerical to assume in psychology an equivalent of
chemical combination. In a complex state there is,
in addition to the component elements, the result
of their reciprocal influences, of their varying relations.
Too often we forget this resultant.</p>

<p>At bottom the ideal is an individual concept. If
objection is offered that an ideal common to a large
mass of men is a fact of common experience (e.g.,
idealists and realists in the fine arts, and even more
so religious, moral, social and political concepts,
etc.), the answer is easy: There are families of
minds. They have a common ideal because, in certain
matters, they have the same way of feeling and
thinking. It is not a transcendental idea that unites<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
them; but this result occurs because from their
common aspirations the collective ideal becomes disengaged;
it is, in scholastic terminology, a <i>universale
post rem</i>.</p>

<p>The ideal conception is the first moment of the
creative act, which is not yet battling with the conditions
of the actual. It is only the internal vision
of an individual mind that has not yet been projected
externally with a form and body. We know how
the passage from the internal to the external life
has given rise among inventors to deceptions and
complaints. Such was the imaginative construction
that could not, unchanged, enter into its mould and
become a reality.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the various forms of this
coagulating<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> principle in advancing from the lowest
to the highest, from the unity vaguely anticipated to
the absolute and tyrannical masterful unity. Following
a method that seems to me best adapted for
these ill-explained questions I shall single out only
the principal forms, which I have reduced to three&mdash;the
unstable, the organic or middle, and the extreme
or semi-morbid unity.</p>

<p>(1) The unstable form has its starting point directly
and immediately in the reproductive imagination
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>without creation. It assembles its elements
somewhat by chance and stitches together the bits
of our life; it ends only in beginnings, in attempts.
The unity-principle is a momentary disposition, vacillating
and changing without cessation according
to the external impressions or modifications of our
vital conditions and of our humor. By way of example
let us recall the state of the day-dreamer
building castles in the air; the delirious constructions
of the insane, the inventions of the child following
all the fluctuations of chance, of its caprice;
the half-coherent dreams that seem to the dreamer
to contain a creative germ. In consequence of the
extreme frailty of the synthetic principle the creative
imagination does not succeed in accomplishing its
task and remains in a condition intermediate between
simple association of ideas and creation proper.</p>

<p>(2) The organic or middle form may be given as
the type of the unifying power. Ultimately it reduces
itself to attention and presupposes nothing
more, because, thanks to the process of "localization,"
which is the essential mark of attention, it
makes itself a center of attraction, grouping about
the leading idea the images, associations, judgments,
tendencies and voluntary efforts. "Inspiration," the
poet Grillparzer used to say, "is a concentration of
all the forces and capacities upon a single point
which, for the time being, should represent the
world rather than enclose it. The reinforcement of
the state of the mind comes from the fact that its
several powers, instead of spreading themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
over the whole world, are contained within the
bounds of a single object, touch one another, reciprocally
help and reinforce each other."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> What the
poet here maintains as regards esthetics only is applicable
to all the <i>organic</i> forms of creation&mdash;that
is to those ruled by an immanent logic, and, like
them, resembling works of Nature.</p>

<p>In order to leave no doubt as to the identity of
attention and imaginative synthesis, and in order
to show that it is normally the true unifying principle,
we offer the following remarks:</p>

<p>Attention is at times spontaneous, natural, without
effort, simply dependent on the interest that a
thing excites in us&mdash;lasting as long as it holds us
in subjection, then ceasing entirely. Again, it is
voluntary, artificial, an imitation of the other, precarious
and intermittent, maintained with effort&mdash;in
a word, laborious. The same is true of the
imagination. The moment of inspiration is ruled
by a perfect and spontaneous unity; its impersonality
approaches that of the forces of Nature. Then
appears the personal moment, the detailed working
and long, painful, intermittent resumptions, the miserable
turns of which so many inventors have described.
The analogy between the two cases seems
to me incontestable.</p>

<p>Next let us note that psychologists always adduce
the same examples when they wish to illustrate on
the one hand, the processes of the persistent, tenacious
attention, and, on the other hand, the developmental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>labor without which creative work does not
come to pass: "Genius is only long patience," the
saying of Newton; "always thinking of it," and like
expressions of d'Alembert, Helmholtz and others,
because in the one case as in the other the fundamental
condition is the existence of a fixed, ever-active
idea, notwithstanding its relaxations and its
incessant disappearances into the unconscious with
return to consciousness.</p>

<p>(3) The extreme form, which from its nature
is semi-morbid, becomes in its highest degree plainly
pathological; the unifying principle changes to a
condition of obsession.</p>

<p>The normal state of our mind is a plurality of
states of consciousness (polyideism). Through association
there is a radiation in every direction. In
this totality of coexisting images no one long occupies
first place; it is driven away by others, which
are displaced in turn by still others emerging from
the penumbra. On the contrary, in attention (relative
monoideism) a single image retains first place
for a long time and tends to have the same importance
again. Finally, in a condition of obsession
(absolute monoideism) the fixed idea defies all rivalry
and rules despotically. Many inventors have
suffered painfully this tyranny and have vainly
struggled to break it. The fixed idea, once settled,
does not permit anything to dislodge it save for the
moment and with much pain. Even then it is displaced
only apparently, for it persists in the unconscious
life where it has thrust its deep roots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>At this stage the unifying principle, although it
can act as a stimulus for creation, is no longer normal.
Consequently, a natural question arises:
Wherein is there a difference between the obsession
of the inventor and the obsession of the insane, who
most generally destroys in place of creating?</p>

<p>The nature of fixed ideas has greatly occupied
contemporary alienists. For other reasons and in
their own way they, too, have been led to divide
obsession into two classes, the intellectual and
emotional, according as the idea or the affective
state predominates. Then they have been led to
ask: Which of these two elements is the primitive
one? For some it is the idea. For others, and it
seems that these are the more numerous, the affective
state is in general the primary fact; the obsession
always rests on a basis of morbid emotion and
in a retention of impressions.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>But whatever opinion we may hold on this point,
the difficulty of establishing a dividing line between
the two forms of obsession above mentioned remains
the same. Are there characters peculiar to
each one?</p>

<p>It has been said: "The physiologically fixed idea
is normally longed for, often sought, in all cases
accepted, and it does not break the unity of the
self." It does not impose itself fatally on consciousness;
the individual knows the value thereof, knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
where it leads him, and adapts his conduct to its
requirements. For example, Christopher Columbus.</p>

<p>The pathological fixed idea is "parasitic," automatic,
discordant, irresistible. Obsession is only a
special case of psychic disintegration, a kind of
doubling of consciousness. The individual becomes
a person "possessed," whose self has been confiscated
for the sake of the fixed idea, and whose submission
to his situation is wrought with pain.</p>

<p>In spite of this parallel the distinguishing criterion
between the two is very vague, because from the
sane to the delirious idea the transitions are very
numerous. We are obliged to recognize "that with
certain workers&mdash;who are rather taken up with the
elaboration of their work, and not masters directing
it, quitting it, and resuming it at their pleasure&mdash;an
artistic, scientific, or mechanical conception
succeeds in haunting the mind, imposing itself upon
it even to the extent of causing suffering." In reality,
pure psychology is unable to discover a positive
difference between obsession leading to creative
work and the other forms, because in both cases
the mental mechanism is, at bottom, the same. The
criterion must be sought elsewhere. For that we
must go out of the internal world and proceed
objectively. We must judge the fixed idea not in
itself but by its effects. What does it produce in
the practical, esthetic, scientific, moral, social, religious
field? It is of value according to its fruits.
If objection be made to this change of front we
may, in order to stick to a strictly psychological<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
point of view, state that it is certain that as soon
as it passes beyond a middle point, which it is
difficult to determine, the fixed idea profoundly
troubles the mechanism of the mind. In imaginative
persons this is not rare, which partly explains
why the pathological theory of genius (of which we
shall speak later) has been able to rally so many to
its support and to allege so many facts in its favor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>IMAGINATION IN ANIMALS</h3>


<p>Up to this point the imagination has been treated
analytically only. This process alone would give
us but a very imperfect idea of its essentially concrete
and lively nature were we to stop here. So
this part continues the subject in another shape. I
shall attempt to follow the imagination in its ascending
development from the lowest to the most complex
forms, from the animal to the human infant,
to primitive man, thence to the highest modes of
invention. It will thus be exhibited in the inexhaustible
variety of its manifestations which the
abstract and simplifying process of analysis does
not permit us to suspect.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>I shall not dwell at length on the imagination of
animals, not only because the question is much involved
but also because it is hardly liable to a positive
solution. Even eliminating mere anecdotes and
doubtful observations, there is no lack of verified
and authentic material, but it still remains to interpret
them. As soon as we begin to conjecture we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
know how difficult it is to divest ourselves of all
anthropomorphism.</p>

<p>The question has been formulated, even if not
treated, with much system by Romanes in his
<i>Mental Evolution in Animals</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Taking "imagination"
in its broadest sense, he recognizes four stages:</p>

<p>1. Provoked revival of images. For example,
the sight of an orange reminds one of its taste.
This is a low form of memory, resting on association
by contiguity. It is met with very far down
in the animal scale, and the author furnishes abundant
proof of it.</p>

<p>2. Spontaneous revival. An object present calls
up an absent object. This is a higher form of
memory, frequent in ants, bees, wasps, etc., which
fact explains the mistrustful sagacity of wild animals.
At night, the distant baying of a hound stops
the fox in his course, because all the dangers he
has undergone are represented in his mind.</p>

<p>These two stages do not go beyond memory pure
and simple, i.e., reproductive imagination. The
other two constitute the higher imagination.</p>

<p>3. The capacity of associating absent images,
without suggestion derived from without, through
an internal working of the mind. It is the lower
and primitive form of the creative imagination,
which may be called a passive synthesis. In order
to establish its existence, Romanes reminds us that
dreams have been proven in dogs, horses, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
large number of birds; that certain animals, especially
in anger, seem to be subject to delusions and
pursued by phantoms; and lastly, that in some
there is produced a condition resembling nostalgia,
expressing itself in a violent desire to return to
former haunts, or in a wasting away resulting from
the absence of accustomed persons and things. All
these facts, especially the latter, can hardly be
explained without a vivid recollection of the images
of previous life.</p>

<p>4. The highest stage consists of intentionally
reuniting images in order to make novel combinations
from them. This may be called an active
synthesis, and is the true creative imagination. Is
this sometimes found in the animal kingdom?
Romanes very clearly replies, no; and not without
offering a plausible reason. For creation, says he,
there must first be capacity for abstraction, and,
without speech, abstraction is very weak. One of
the conditions for creative imagination is thus
wanting in the higher animals.</p>

<p>We here come to one of those critical moments,
so frequent in animal psychology, when one asks,
Is this character exclusively human, or is it found
in embryo in lower forms? Thus it has been possible
to support a theory opposing that of Romanes.
Certain animals, says Oelzelt-Newin, fulfill all the
conditions necessary for creative imagination&mdash;subtle
senses, good memory, and appropriate emotional
states.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This assertion is perhaps true, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
it is purely dialectic. It is equivalent to saying that
the thing is possible; it does not establish it as a
fact. Besides, is it very certain that all the conditions
for creative imagination are present here,
since we have just shown that there is lack of
abstraction? The author, who voluntarily limits
his study to birds and the construction of their
nests, maintains, against Wallace and others, that
nest-building requires "the mysterious synthesis of
representations." We might with equal reason
bring the instances of other building animals (bees,
wasps, white ants, the common ants, beavers, etc.).
It is not unreasonable to attribute to them an
anticipated representation of their architecture.
Shall we say that it is "instinctive," consequently
unconscious? At least, may we not group under
this head, changes and adaptations to new conditions
which these animals succeed in applying to
the typical plans of their construction? Observations
and even systematic experiments (like those
of Huber, Forel, <i>et al.</i>) show that, reduced to the
alternative of the impossibility of building or the
modification of their habits, certain animals modify
them. Judging from this, how refuse them invention
altogether? This contradicts in no way the
very just reservation of Romanes. It is sufficient
to remark that abstraction or dissociation has stages,
that the simplest are accessible to the animal intelligence.
If, in the absence of words, the logic of
concepts is forbidden it, there yet remains the logic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of images,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which is sufficient for slight innovations.
In a word, animals can invent according to
the extent that they can dissociate.</p>

<p>In our opinion, if we may with any truthfulness
attribute a creative power to animals, we must seek
it elsewhere. Generally speaking, we attribute only
a mediocre importance to a manifestation that
might very well be the proper form of animal fancy.
It is purely motor, and expresses itself through the
various kinds of play.</p>

<p>Although play may be as old as mankind, its
psychology dates only from the nineteenth century.
We have already seen that there are three theories
concerning its nature&mdash;it is "expenditure of superfluous
activity," "a mending, restoring of strength,
a recuperation," "an apprenticeship, a preliminary
exercise for the active functions of life and for the
development of our natural gifts."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The last position,
due to Groos, does not rule out the other two;
it holds the first valid for the young, the second for
adults; but it comprehends both in a more general
explanation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p><p>Let us leave this doctrinal question in order to
call attention to the variety and richness of form
of play in the animal world. In this respect the
aforementioned book of Groos is a rich mine of
evidence to which I would refer the reader. I limit
myself to summing up his classification. He distinguishes
nine classes of play, viz.: (1) Those
that are at bottom experimental, consisting of trials
at hazard without immediate end, often giving the
animal a certain knowledge of the properties of the
external world. This is the introduction to an
experimental physics, optics, and mechanics for the
brood of animals. (2) Movements or changes of
place executed of their own accord&mdash;a very general
fact as is proven by the incessant movements of
butterflies, flies, birds, and even fishes, which often
appear to play in the water rather than to seek prey;
the mad running of horses, dogs, etc., in free space.
(3) Mimicry of hunting, i.e., playing with a living
or dead prey: the dog and cat following moving
objects, a ball, feather, etc. (4) Mimic battles,
teasing and fighting without anger. (5) Architectural
art, revealing itself especially in the building
of nests: certain birds ornament them with
shining objects (stones, bits of glass), by a kind
of anticipation of the esthetic feeling. (6) Doll-play
is universal in mankind, whether civilized or
savage. Groos believes he has found its equivalent
in certain animals. (7) Imitation through pleasure,
so familiar in monkeys (grimaces); singing-birds
which counterfeit the voices of a large number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
beasts. (8) Curiosity, which is the only mental
play one meets in animals&mdash;the dog watching, from
a wall or window, what is going on in the street.
(9) Love-plays, "which differ from the others in
that they are not mere exercises, but have in view
a real object." They have been well-known since
Darwin's time, he attributing to them an esthetic
value which has been denied by Wallace, Tylor,
Lloyd Morgan, Wallaschek, and Groos.</p>

<p>Let us recapitulate in thought the immense
quantity of motor expressions included in these nine
categories and let us note that they have the following
characters in common: They are grouped
in combinations that are often new and unforeseen;
they are not a repetition of daily life, acts necessary
for self-preservation. At one time the movements
are combined simultaneously (exhibition of beautiful
colors), again (and most often) successively
(amorous parades, fights, flight, dancing, emission
of noises, sounds or songs); but, under one form or
another, there is <i>creation</i>, <i>invention</i>. Here, the
imagination acts in its purely motor character; it
consists of a small number of images that become
translated into actions, and serve as a center for
their grouping; perhaps even the image itself is
hardly conscious, so that all is limited to a spontaneous
production and a collection of motor phenomena.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be said that this form of imagination
belongs to a very shallow, poor psychology.
It cannot be otherwise. It is necessary that imaginative
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>production be found reduced to its simplest
expression in animals, and the motor form must be
its special characteristic mark. It cannot have any
others for the following reasons: incapacity for
the work that necessarily precedes abstraction or
dissociation, breaking into bits the data of experience,
making them raw material for the future
construction; lack of images, and especially fewness
of possible combinations of images. This last point
is proven alike from the data of animal psychology
and of comparative anatomy. We know that the
nervous elements in the brain serving as connections
between sensory regions&mdash;whether one conceive of
them as centers (Flechsig), or as bundles of commisural
fibers (Meynert, Wernicke)&mdash;are hardly
outlined in the lower mammalia and attain only a
mediocre development in the higher forms.</p>

<p>By way of corroboration of the foregoing, let us
compare the higher animals with young children:
this comparison is not based on a few far-fetched
analogies, but in a thorough resemblance in nature.
Man, during the first years of his life, has a brain
but slightly differentiated, especially as regards
connections, a very poor supply of images, a very
weak capacity for abstraction. His intellectual
development is much inferior to that of reflex,
instinctive, impulsive, and imitative movements. In
consequence of this predominance of the motor
system, the simple and imperfect images, in children
as in animals, tend to be immediately changed
into movements. Even most of their inventions in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
play are greatly inferior to those enumerated above
under nine distinct heads.</p>

<p>A serious argument in favor of the prevalence
of imagination of the motor type in the child is
furnished by the principal part taken by movements
in infantile insanity: a remark made by many
alienists. The first stage of this madness, they say,
is found in the convulsions that are not merely a
physical ailment, but "a muscular delirium." The
disturbance of the automatic and instinctive functions
of the child is so often associated with muscular
disturbances that at this age the mental disorders
correspond to the motor ganglionic centers
situated below those parts that later assume the
labor of analysis and of imagination. The disturbances
are in the primary centers of organization and
according to the symptoms lack those analytic or
constructive qualities, those ideal forms, that we
find in adult insanity. If we descend to the lowest
stage of human life&mdash;to the baby&mdash;we see that
insanity consists almost entirely of the activity of
a muscular group acting on external objects. The
insane baby bites, kicks, and these symptoms are
the external measure of the degree of its madness.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Has not chorea itself been called a muscular insanity?</p>

<p>Doubtless, there likewise exists in the child a
sensorial madness (illusions, hallucinations); but
by reason of its feeble intellectual development the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
delirium causes a disorder of movements rather
than of images; its insane imagination is above all
a motor insanity.</p>

<p>To hold that the creative imagination belonging
to animals consists of new combinations of movements
is certainly an hypothesis. Nevertheless, I
do not believe that it is merely a mental form without
foundation, if we take into account the foregoing
facts. I consider it rather as a point in favor
of the motor theory of invention. It is a singular
instance in which the original form of creation is
shown bare. If we wanted to discover it, it would
be necessary to seek it where it is reduced to the
greatest simplicity&mdash;in the animal world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE CREATIVE IMAGINATION IN THE CHILD</h3>


<p>At what age, in what form, under what conditions
does the creative imagination make its appearance?
It is impossible to answer this question,
which, moreover, has no justification. For the
creative imagination develops little by little out of
pure reproduction by an evolutionary process, not
by sudden eruption. Nevertheless, its evolution is
very slow on account of causes both organic and
psychological.</p>

<p>We could not dwell long on the organic causes
without falling into tiresome repetitions. The new-born
infant is a spinal being, with an unformed
diffluent brain, composed largely of water. Reflex
life itself is not complete in him, and the cortico-motor
system only hinted at; the sensory centers
are undifferentiated, the associational systems remain
isolated for a long time after birth. We have
given above Flechsig's observation on this point.</p>

<p>The psychological causes reduce themselves to
the necessity for a consolidation of the primary and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
secondary operations of the mind, without which
the creative imagination cannot take form. To be
precise, we might distinguish, as does Baldwin, four
epochs in the mental development of the child: (1)
affective (rudimentary sensory processes, pleasures
and pains, simple motor adaptations); (2) and (3)
objective, in which the author establishes two
grades, (a) appearance of special senses, of memory,
instincts primarily defensive, and imitation;
(b) complex memory, complicated movements,
offensive activities, rudimentary will; (4) subjective
or final (conscious thought, constitutive will,
ideal emotions). If we accept this scheme as
approximately correct, the <i>moment</i> of imagination
must be assigned to the third period (the second
stage of the objective epoch) which fulfills all the
sufficient and necessary conditions for its origination
and for its rise above pure reproduction.</p>

<p>Whatever the propitious age may be, the study
of the child-imagination is not without difficulties.
In order to enter into the child-mind, we must
become like a child; as it is, we are limited to an
interpretation of it in terms of the adult, with much
false interpretation possible, agreeing too much or
too little with the facts. Furthermore, the children
studied live and grow up in a civilized environment.
The result is that the development of their imagination
is rarely unhampered and complete; for as soon
as their fancy passes the middle level, the rationalizing
education of parents and teachers is eager to
master and control it. In truth it gives its full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
measure and reveals itself in the fulness of growth
only among primitive peoples. With us it is
checked in its flight by an antagonistic power,
which treats it as a harbinger of insanity. Finally,
children are not equally well-suited for this study;
we must make a distinction between the imaginative
and non-imaginative, and the latter should be eliminated.</p>

<p>When we have thus chosen suitable subjects,
observation shows from the start sufficiently distinct
varieties, different orientations of the imagination
depending on intellectual causes, such as the
predominance of visual or acoustic or tactile-motor
images making for mechanical invention; or dependent
on emotional causes, that is, of character,
according as the latter is timid, joyous, exuberant,
retired, healthy, sickly, etc.</p>

<p>If we now attempt to follow the development of
the child-imagination, we may distinguish four
principal stages, without assigning them, otherwise,
a rigorous chronological order.</p>

<p>1. The first stage consists of the passage from
passive to creative imagination. Its history would
be long were we to include all the hybrid forms that
are made up partly of memories, partly of new
groupings, being at the same time repetition and
construction. Even in the adult, they are very frequent.
I know a person who is always afraid of
being smothered, and for this reason urgently asks
that in his coffin his shirt be not tight at the neck:
this odd prepossession of the mind belongs neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to memory nor to imagination. This particular
case illustrates in a very clear form the nature of
the first flights of the mind attempting to exercise
its imaginative powers. Without enumerating other
facts of this kind, it is more desirable to follow the
imagination's development, limiting ourselves to
two forms of the psychic life&mdash;perception and illusion.
The necessary presence of the image in these
two forms has been so often proven by contemporary
psychology that a few words to recall this
to mind will be sufficient.</p>

<p>There seems to be a radical difference between
perception, which seizes reality, and imagination.
Nevertheless, it is generally admitted that in order
to rise above sensation to perception, there must be
a synthesis of images. To put it more simply, two
elements are required&mdash;one, coming from without,
the physiological stimulus acting on the nerves and
the sensory centers, which becomes translated in
consciousness through the vague state that goes by
the name "sensation"; the other, coming from within,
adds to the sensations present appropriate images,
remnants of former experiences. So that perception
requires an apprenticeship; we must feel, then imperfectly
perceive, in order to finally perceive well.
The sensory datum is only a fraction of the total
fact; and in the operation we call "perceiving," that
is, apprehending an object directly, a part only of
the object is represented.</p>

<p>This, however, does not go beyond reproductive
imagination. The decisive step is taken in illusion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
We know that illusion has as a basis and support a
modification of the external senses which are metamorphosed,
amplified by an immediate construction
of the mind: a branch of a tree becomes a serpent,
a distant noise seems the music of an orchestra.
Illusion has as broad a field as perception, since
there is no perception but may undergo this erroneous
transformation, and it is produced by the same
mechanism, but with interchange of the two terms.
In perception, the chief element is the sensory, and
the representative element is secondary; in illusion,
we have just the opposite condition: what one takes
as perceived is merely imagined&mdash;the imagination
assumes the principal r&ocirc;le. Illusion is the type of
the transitional forms, of the mixed cases, that consist
of constructions made up of memories, without
being, in the strict sense, creations.</p>

<p>2. The creative imagination asserts itself with
its peculiar characteristics only in the second stage,
in the form of animism or the attributing of life
to everything. This turn of the mind is already
known to us, though mentioned only incidentally.
As the state of the child's mind at that period
resembles that which in primitive man creates
myths, we shall return to it in the next chapter.
Works on psychology abound in facts demonstrating
that this primitive tendency to attribute life and
even personality to everything is a necessary phase
that the mind must undergo&mdash;long or short in duration,
rich or poor in inventions, according to the
level of the child's imagination. His attitude towards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>his dolls is the common example of this state,
and also the best example, because it is universal,
being found in all countries without exception,
among all races of men. It is needless to pile up
facts on an uncontroverted point.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Two will suffice;
I choose them on account of their extravagance,
which shows that at this particular moment
animism, in certain minds, can dare anything. "One
little fellow, aged one year eight months, conceived
a special fondness for the letter W, addressing it
thus: 'Dear old boy W.' Another little boy well
on in his fourth year, when tracing a letter L, happened
to slip, so that the horizontal limb formed
an angle, thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 84px;">
<img src="images/fig001.jpg" width="84" height="87" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He instantly saw the resemblance
to the sedentary human form, and said:
'Oh, he's sitting down.' Similarly, when he made
an F turn the wrong way and then put the correct
form to the left, thus,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 96px;">
<img src="images/fig002.jpg" width="96" height="81" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>he exclaimed, 'They're
talking together!'" One of Sully's correspondents
says: "I had the habit of attributing intelligence
not only to all living creatures ... but even
to stones and manufactured articles. I used to feel
how dull it must be for the pebbles in the causeway
to lie still and only see what was round about.
When I walked out with a basket for putting
flowers in, I used sometimes to pick up a pebble or
two and carry them out to have a change."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us stop a moment in order to try to determine
the nature of this strange mental state, all the more
as we shall meet it again in primitive man, and since
it presents the creative imagination at its beginning.</p>

<p>a. The first element is a fixed idea, or rather, an
image, or group of images, that takes possession of
consciousness to the exclusion of everything else:&mdash;it
is the analogue of the state of suggestion in the
hypnotized subject, with this sole difference&mdash;that
the suggestion does not come from without, from
another, but from the child itself&mdash;it is auto-suggestion.
The stick that the child holds between his
legs becomes for him an imaginary steed. The
poverty of his mental development makes all the
easier this contraction of the field of his consciousness,
which assures the supremacy of the image.</p>

<p>b. This has as its basis a reality that it includes.
This is an important detail to note, because this
reality, however tiny, gives objectivity to the imaginary
creation and incorporates it with the external
world. The mechanism is like that which produces
illusion, but with a stable character excluding correction.
The child transforms a bit of wood or
paper into another self, because he perceives only
the phantom he has created; that is, the images, not
the material exciting them, haunt his brain.</p>

<p>c. Lastly, this creative power investing the image
with all its attributes of real existence is derived
from a fundamental fact&mdash;the state of belief, i.e.,
adherence of the mind founded on purely subjective
conditions. It does not come within my province to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
treat incidentally such a large question. Neglected
by the older physiology, whose faculty-method inclined
it toward this omission, belief or faith has
recently become the object of numerous studies.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
I necessarily limit myself to remarking that but for
this psychic state, the nature of the imagination is
totally incomprehensible. The peculiarity of the
imagination is the production of a reality of human
origin, and it succeeds therein only because of the
faith accompanying the image.</p>

<p>Representation and belief are not completely
separated; it is the nature of the image to appear
at first as a real object. This psychological truth,
though proven through observation, has made itself
acceptable only with great difficulty. It has had to
struggle on the one hand against the prejudices of
common-sense for which imagination is synonymous
with sham and vain appearance and opposed to the
real as non-being to being; on the other hand,
against a doctrine of the logicians who maintain
that the idea is at first merely conceived with no
affirmation of existence or non-existence (<i>apprehensio
simplex</i>). This position, legitimate in logic,
which is an abstract science, is altogether unacceptable
in psychology, a concrete science. The psychological
viewpoint giving the true nature of the
image has prevailed little by little. Spinoza already
asserts "that representations considered by themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>contain no errors," and he "denies that it is
possible to perceive [represent] without affirming."
More explicitly, Hume assigns belief to our subjective
dispositions: Belief does not depend on the
nature of the idea, but on the manner in which we
conceive it. Existence is not a quality added to it
by us; it is founded on habit and is irresistible.
The difference between fiction and belief consists of
a feeling added to the latter but not to the former.
Dugald Stewart treats the question purely as a
psychologist following the experimental method.
He enumerates very many facts whence he concludes
that imagination is always accompanied by
an act of belief, but for which fact the more vivid
the image, the less one would believe it; but just
the contrary happens&mdash;the strong representation
commands persuasion like sensation itself. Finally,
Taine treats the subject methodically, by studying
the nature of the image and its primitive character
of hallucination.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> At present, I think, there is no
psychologist who does not regard as proven that
the image, when it enters consciousness, has two
moments. During the first, it is objective, appearing
as a full and complete reality; during the
second, which is definitive, it is deprived of its
objectivity, reduced to a completely internal event,
through the effect of other states of consciousness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
which oppose and finally annihilate its objective
character. There is an affirmation, then negation;
impulse, then inhibition.</p>

<p>Faith, being only a mode of existence, an attitude
of the mind, owes its creative and vivifying power
to general dispositions of our constitution. Besides
the intellectual element which is its content, its
material&mdash;the thing affirmed or denied&mdash;there are
tendencies and other affective factors (desire, fear,
love, etc.) giving the image its intensity, and assuring
it success in the struggle against other states
of consciousness. There are active faculties that
we sometimes designate by the name "will," understanding
by the term, as James says, not only deliberate
volition, but all the factors of belief (hope,
fear, passions, prejudices, sectarian feeling, and so
forth),<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and this has justly given rise to the truthful
saying that the test of belief is action.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> This
explains how in love, religion, in the moral life, in
politics, and elsewhere, belief can withstand the
logical assaults of the rationalizing intelligence&mdash;its
power is found everywhere. It lasts as long as
the mind waits and consents; but, as soon as these
affective and active dispositions disappear in life's
experience, faith falls with them, leaving in its place
a formless content, an empty and dead representation.</p>

<p>After this, is it necessary to remark that belief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
depends peculiarly on the motor elements of our
organization and not on the intellectual? As there
is no imagination without belief, nor belief without
imagination, we return by another route to the
thesis supported in the first part of this essay, that
creative activity depends on the motor nature of
images.</p>

<p>Insofar as concerns the special case of the child,
the first of the two moments (the affirming) that
the image undergoes in consciousness is all in all
for him, the second (the rectifying) is nothing:
there is hypertrophy of one, atrophy of the other.
For the adult the contrary is true&mdash;in many cases,
indeed, in consequence of experience and habit,
the first moment, wherein the image should be
affirmed as a reality, is only virtual, is literally
atrophied. We must, however, remark that this
applies only partially to the ignorant and even less
to the savage.</p>

<p>We might, nevertheless, ask ourselves if the
child's belief in his phantoms is complete, entire,
absolute, unreserved. Is the stick that he bestrides
perfectly identified with a horse? Was Sully's child,
that showed its doll a series of engravings to choose
from, completely deceived? It seems that we must
rather admit an intermittence, an alteration between
affirmation and negation. On the one hand,
the skeptical attitude of those who laugh at it displeases
the child, who is like a devout believer
whose faith is being broken down. On the other
hand, doubt must indeed arise in him from time to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
time, for without this, rectification could never
occur&mdash;one belief opposes the other or drives it
away. This second work proceeds little by little,
but then, under this form, imagination retreats.</p>

<p>3. The third stage is that of play, which, in
chronological order, coincides with the one just
preceding. As a form of creation it is already
known to us, but in passing from animals to children,
it grows in complexity and becomes intellectualized.
It is no longer a simple combination of images.</p>

<p>Play serves two ends&mdash;for experimenting: as
such it is an introduction to knowledge, gives certain
vague notions concerning the nature of things;
for creating: this is its principal function.</p>

<p>The human child, like the animal, expends itself
in movements, forms associations new to it, simulates
defence, flight, attack; but the child soon
passes beyond this lower stage, in order to construct
by means of images (ideally). He begins by imitating:
this is a physiological necessity, reasons for
which we shall give later (see chapter iv. <i>infra</i>).
He constructs houses, boats, gives himself up to
large plans; but he imitates most in his own person
and acts, making himself in turn soldier, sailor,
robber, merchant, coachman, etc.</p>

<p>To the period of imitation succeed more serious
attempts&mdash;he acts with a "spirit of mastery," he is
possessed by his idea which he tends to realize.
The personal character of creation is shown in that
he is really interested only in a work that emanates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
from himself and of which he feels himself the
cause. B. Perez relates that he wanted to give a
lesson to his nephew, aged three and a half years,
whose inventions seemed to him very poor. Perez
scratched in the sand a trench resembling a river,
planted little branches on both banks, and had water
flow through it; put a bridge across, and launched
boats. At each new act the child would remain
cool, his admiration would always have to be waited
for. Out of patience, he remarked shortly that
"this isn't at all entertaining." The author adds:
"I believed it useless to persist, and I trampled
under foot, laughing at myself, my awkward attempt
at a childish construction."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> "I had already
read it in many a book, but this time I had learned
from experience that the free initiative of children
is always superior to the imitations we pretend to
make for them. In addition, this experience and
others like it have taught me that their creative
force is much weaker than has been said."</p>

<p>4. At the fourth stage appears romantic invention,
which requires a more refined culture, being
a purely internal, wholly imaginative (i.e., cast in
images) creation. It begins at about three or
four years of age. We know the taste of imaginative
children for stories and legends, which they
have repeated to them until surfeited: in this
respect they resemble semi-civilized people, who
listen greedily to rhapsodies for hours at a time,
experiencing all the emotions appropriate to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
incidents of the tale. This is the prelude to creation,
a semi-passive, semi-active state, an apprentice
period, which will permit them to create in their
own turn. Thus the first attempts are made with
reminiscences, and imitated rather than created.</p>

<p>Of this we find numerous examples in the special
works. A child of three and a half saw a lame man
going along a road, and exclaimed: "Look at that
poor ole man, mamma, he has dot [got] a bad leg."
Then the romance begins: He was on a high horse;
he fell on a rock, struck his poor leg; he will have
to get some powder to heal it, etc. Sometimes the
invention is less realistic. A child of three often
longed to live like a fish in the water, or like a star
in the sky. Another, aged five years nine months,
having found a hollow rock, invented a fairy story:
the hole was a beautiful hall inhabited by brilliant
mysterious personages, etc.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>This form of imagination is not as common as
the others. It belongs to those whom nature has
well endowed. It forecasts a development of mind
above the average. It may even be the sign of an
inborn vocation and indicate in what direction the
creative activity will be orientated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us briefly recall the creative r&ocirc;le of the
imagination in language, through the intervening
of a factor already studied&mdash;thinking by analogy,
an abundant source of often picturesque metaphors.
A child called the cork of a bottle "door;" a small
coin was called by a little American a "baby dollar;"
another, seeing the dew on the grass, said, "The
grass is crying."</p>

<p>The extension of the meaning of words has been
studied by Taine, Darwin, Preyer, and others. They
have shown that its psychological mechanism depends
sometimes on the perception of resemblance,
again on association by contiguity, processes that
appear and intermingle in an unforeseen manner.
Thus, a child applies the word "mambro" at first
to his nurse, then to a sewing machine that she uses,
then by analogy to an organ that he sees on the
street adorned with a monkey, then to his toys
representing animals.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> We have elsewhere given
more similar cases, where we perceive the fundamental
difference between thought by imagery and
rational thought.</p>

<p>To conclude: At this period the imagination is
the master-faculty and the highest form of intellectual
development. It works in two directions,
one principal&mdash;it creates plays, invents romances,
and extends language; the other secondary&mdash;it
contains a germ of thought and ventures a fanciful
explanation of the world which can not yet be conceived
according to abstract notions and laws.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>PRIMITIVE MAN AND THE CREATION OF MYTHS</h3>


<p>We come now to a unique period in the history
of the development of the imagination&mdash;its golden
age. In primitive man, still confined in savagery
or just starting toward civilization, it reaches its
full bloom in the creation of myths; and we are
rightly astonished that psychologists, obstinately
attached to esthetics, have neglected such an important
form of activity, one so rich in information
concerning the creative imagination. Where, indeed,
find more favorable conditions for knowing it?</p>

<p>Man, prior to civilization, is a purely imaginative
being; that is, the imagination marks the summit of
his intellectual development. He does not go
beyond this stage, but it is no longer an enigma as
in animals, nor a transitory phase as in the civilized
child who rapidly advances to the age of reason;
it is a fixed state, permanent and lasting throughout
life.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> It is there revealed to us in its entire spontaneity:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>it has free rein; it can create without
imitation or tradition; it is not imprisoned in any
conventional form; it is sovereign. As primitive
man has knowledge neither of nature nor of its
laws, he does not hesitate to embody the most senseless
imaginings flitting through his brain. The
world is not, for him, a totality of phenomena
subject to laws, and nothing limits or hinders him.</p>

<p>This working of the pure imagination, left to
itself and unadulterated by the intrusion and
tyranny of rational elements, becomes translated
into one form&mdash;the creation of myths; an anonymous,
unconscious work, which, as long as its rule
lasts, is sufficient in every way, comprehends everything&mdash;religion,
poetry, history, science, philosophy,
law.</p>

<p>Myths have the advantage of being the incarnation
of pure imagination, and, moreover, they permit
psychologists to study them objectively. Thanks
to the labors of the nineteenth century, they offer
an almost inexhaustible content. While past ages
forgot, misunderstood, disfigured, and often despised
myths as aberrations of the human mind, as
unworthy of an hour's attention, it is no longer
necessary in our time to show their interest and
importance, even for psychology, which, however,
has not as yet drawn all the benefit possible from
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>But before commencing the psychological study
of the genesis and formation of myths considered
as an objective emanation of the creative imagination,
we must briefly summarize the hypotheses at
present offered for their origin. We find two principal
ones&mdash;the one, etymological, genealogical, or
linguistic; the other, ethno-psychological, or anthropological.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The first, whose principal though not sole champion
is Max M&uuml;ller, holds that myths are the result
of a disease of language&mdash;words become things,
"nomina numina." This transformation is the
effect of two principal linguistic causes&mdash;(a) Polynomy;
several words for one thing. Thus the sun
is designated by more than twenty names in the
Vedas; Apollo, Phaethon, Hercules are three personifications
of the sun; <i>Varouna</i> (night) and
<i>Yama</i> (death) express at first the same conception,
and have become two distinct deities. In short,
every word tends to become an entity having its
attributes and its legends. (b) Homonomy, a
single word for several things. The same adjective,
"shining," refers to the sun, a fountain, spring, etc.
This is another source of confusion. Let us also
add metaphors taken literally, plays upon words,
wrong construction, etc.</p>

<p>The opponents of this doctrine maintain that in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the formation of myths, words represent scarcely
five per cent. Whatever may be the worth of this
assertion, the purely philological explanation remains
without value for psychology: it is neither
true nor false&mdash;it does not solve the question; it
merely avoids it. The word is only an occasion, a
vehicle; without the working of the mind exciting
it, nothing would change. Moreover, Max M&uuml;ller
himself has recently recognized this.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The anthropological theory, much more general
than the foregoing, penetrates further to psychological
origins&mdash;it leads us to the first advances of
the human mind. It regards the myth not as an
accident of primitive life, but as a natural function,
a mode of activity proper to man during a certain
period of his development. Later, the mythic creations
seem absurd, often immoral, because they are
survivals of a distant epoch, cherished and consecrated
through tradition, habits, and respect for
antiquity. According to the definition that seems
to me best adapted for psychology, the myth is
"the psychological objectification of man in all the
phenomena that he can perceive."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It is a humanization
of nature according to processes peculiar to
the imagination.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>Are these two views irreconcilable? It does not
seem so to me, provided we accept the first as only
a partial explanation. In any event, both schools
agree on one point important for us&mdash;that the
material for myths is furnished by the observation
of natural phenomena, including the great events
of human life: birth, sickness, death, etc. This is
the objective factor. The creation of myths has its
explanation in the nature of human imagination&mdash;this
is the subjective factor. We can not deny that
most works on mythology have a very decided
tendency to give the greater importance to the first
factor; in which respect they need a little psychology.
The periodic returns of the dawn, the sun,
the moon and stars, winds and storms, have their
effect also, we may suppose, on monkeys, elephants,
and other animals supposedly the most intelligent.
Have they inspired myths? Just the opposite: "the
surprising monotony of the ideas that the various
races have made final causes of phenomena, of the
origin and destiny of man, whence it results that
the numberless myths are reduced to a very small
number of types,"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> shows that it is the human
imagination that takes the principal part and that
it is on the whole perhaps not so rich as we are
pleased to say&mdash;that it is even very poor, compared
to the fecundity of nature.</p>

<p>Let us now study the psychology of this creative
activity, reducing it to these two questions: How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
are myths formed? What line does their evolution
follow?</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The psychology of the origin of the myth, of the
work that causes its rise, may theoretically, and for
the sake of facilitating analysis, be regarded as two
principal moments&mdash;that of creation proper, and
that of romantic invention.</p>

<p>a. The moment of creation presupposes two
inseparable operations which, however, we have to
describe separately. The first consists of attributing
life to all things, the second of assigning qualities
to all things.</p>

<p>Animating everything, that is attributing life
and action to everything, representing everything to
one's self as living and acting&mdash;even mountains,
rocks, and other objects (seemingly) incapable of
movement. Of this inborn and irresistible tendency
there are so many facts in proof that an enumeration
is needless: it is the rule. The evidence gathered
by ethnologists, mythologists, and travelers fills
large volumes. This state of mind does not particularly
belong to long-past ages. It is still in
existence, it is contemporary, and if we would see
it with our own eyes it is not at all necessary to
plunge into virgin countries, for there are frequent
reversions even in civilized lands. On the whole,
says Tylor, it must be regarded as conceded that to
the lower races of humanity the sun and stars, the
trees and rivers, the winds and clouds, become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
animated creatures living like men and beasts, fulfilling
their special function in creation&mdash;or rather
that what the human eye can reach is only the
instrument or the matter of which some gigantic
being, like a man, hidden behind the visible things,
makes use. The grounds on which such ideas are
based cannot be regarded as less than a poetic fancy
or an ill-understood metaphor; they depend on a
vast philosophy of nature, certainly rude and primitive,
but coherent and serious.</p>

<p>The second operation of the mind, inseparable,
as we have said, from the first, attributes to these
imaginary beings various qualities, but all important
to man. They are good or bad, useful or
hurtful, weak or powerful, kind or cruel. One
remains stupefied before the swarming of these
numberless genii whom no natural phenomenon, no
act of life, no form of sickness escapes, and these
beliefs remain unbroken even among the tribes that
are in contact with old civilizations.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Primitive
man lives and moves among the ceaseless phantoms
of his own imagination.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p><p>Lastly, the psychological mechanism of the creative
moment is very simple. It depends on a single
factor previously studied&mdash;thinking by analogy. It
is a matter first of all&mdash;and this is important&mdash;of
conceiving beings analogous to ourselves, cast in
our mould, cut after our pattern; that is, feeling
and acting; then qualifying them and determining
them according to the attributes of our own nature.
But the logic of images, very different from that of
reason, concludes an objective resemblance; it regards
as alike, what seem alike; it attributes to an
internal linking of images, the validity of an objective
connection between things. Whence arises the
discord between the imagined world and the world
of reality. "Analogies that for us are only fancies
were for the man of past ages real" (Tylor).</p>

<p>b. In the genesis of myths, the second moment
is that of fanciful invention. Entities take form;
they have a history and adventures: they become
the stuff for a romance. People of poor and dry
imagination do not reach the second period. Thus,
the religion of the Romans peopled the universe
with an innumerable quantity of genii. No object,
no act, no detail, but had its own presiding genius.
There was one for germinating grain, for sprouting
grain, for grain in flower, for blighted grain; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the door, its hinges, its lock, etc. There was a
myriad of misty, formless entities. This is animism
arrested at its first stage; abstraction has killed
imagination.</p>

<p>Who created those legends and tales of adventure
constituting the subject-matter of mythology?
Probably inspired individuals, priests or prophets.
They came perhaps from dreams, hallucinations,
insane attacks&mdash;they are derived from several
sources. Whatever their origin, they are the work
of imaginative minds <i>par excellence</i> (we shall study
them later) who, confronted with any event whatever,
must, because of their nature, construct a
romance.</p>

<p>Besides analogy, this imaginative creation has as
its principal source the associational form already
described under the name "constellation." We
know that it is based on the fact that, in certain
cases, the arousing of an image-group is the result
of a tendency prevailing at a given instant over
several that are possible. This operation has already
been expounded theoretically with individual
examples in support.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> But in order to gauge its
importance, we must see it act in large masses.
Myths allow us to do this. Ordinarily they have
been studied in their historical development according
to their geographical distribution or ethnic character.
If we proceed otherwise, if we consider only
their content&mdash;i.e., the very few themes upon which
the human imagination has labored, such as celestial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
phenomena, terrestrial disturbances, floods, the
origin of the universe, of man, etc.&mdash;we are surprised
at the wonderful richness of variety. What
diversity in the solar myths, or those of creation,
of fire, of water! These variations are due to
multiple causes, which have orientated the imagination
now in one direction, now in another. Let
us mention the principal ones: Racial characteristics&mdash;whether
the imagination is clear or mobile,
poor or exuberant; the manner of living&mdash;totally
savage, or on a level of civilization; the physical
environment&mdash;external nature cannot be reflected
in the brain of a Hindoo in the same way as in
that of a Scandinavian; and lastly, that assemblage
of considerable and unexpected causes grouped
under the term "chance."</p>

<p>The variable combinations of these different
factors, with the predominance of one or the other,
explain the multiplicity of the imaginative conceptions
of the world, in contrast to the unity and
simplicity of scientific conceptions.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The form of imagination now occupying our
attention by reason of its non-individual, anonymous,
collective character, attains a long development
that we may follow in its successive phases
of ascent, climax, and decline. To begin with, is it
necessarily inherent in the human mind? Are there
races or groups of men totally devoid of myths?
which is a slightly different question from that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
usually asked, "Are there tribes totally devoid of
religious thoughts?" Although it is very doubtful
that there are such now, it is probable that there
were in the beginning, when man had scarcely left
the brute level&mdash;at least if we agree with Vignoli<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
that we already find in the higher animals embryonic
forms of animism.</p>

<p>In any event, mythic creation appears early. We
can infer this from the signs of puerility of certain
legends. Savages who could not know themselves&mdash;the
Iroquois, the Australian aborigines, the natives
of the Andaman Islands&mdash;believed that the
earth was at first sterile and dry, all the water
having been swallowed by a gigantic frog or toad
which was compelled, by queer stratagems, to
regurgitate it. These are little children's imaginings.
Among the Hindoos the same myth takes
the form of an alluring epic&mdash;the dragon watching
over the celestial waters, of which he has taken
possession, is wounded by Indra after a heroic
battle, and restores them to the earth.</p>

<p>Cosmogonies, Lang remarks, furnish a good
example of the development of myths; it is possible
to mark out stages and rounds according to the
degree of culture and intelligence. The natives of
Oceania believe that the world was created and
organized by spiders, grasshoppers, and various
birds. More advanced peoples regard powerful
animals as gods in disguise (such are certain Mexican
divinities). Later, all trace of animal worship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
disappears, and the character of the myth is purely
anthropomorphic.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> K&uuml;hn, in a special work, has
shown how the successive stages of social evolution
express themselves in the successive stages of mythology&mdash;myths
of cannibals, of hunters, of herders,
land-tillers, sailors. Speaking of pure savagery,
Max M&uuml;ller<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> admits at least two periods&mdash;pan-Aryan
and Indo-Iranian&mdash;prior to the Vedic period.
In the course of this slow evolution the work of the
imagination passes little by little from infancy,
becomes more and more complex, subtle and refined.</p>

<p>In the Aryan race, the Vedic epoch, despite its
sacerdotal ritualism, is considered as the period <i>par
excellence</i> of mythic efflorescence. "The myth,"
says Taine, "is not here (in the Vedas) a disguise,
but an expression; no language is more true and
more supple: it permits a glimpse of, or rather
causes us to discern, the forms of mist, the movements
of the air, change of seasons, all the accidents
of sky, fire, storm: external nature has never found
a mode of thought so graceful and flexible for
reflecting itself thereby in all the inexhaustible
variety of her appearances. However changeable
nature may be, the imagination is equally so."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> It
animates everything&mdash;not only fire in general, <i>Agni</i>,
but also the seven forms of flame, the wood that
lights it, the ten fingers of the sacrificing priest, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
prayer itself, and even the railing surrounding the
altar. This is one example among many others.
The partisans of the linguistic theory have been able
to maintain that at this moment every word is a
myth, because every word is a name designating a
quality or an act, transformed by the imagination
into substance. Max M&uuml;ller has translated a page
of Hesiod, substituting the analytic, abstract, rational
language of our time for the image-making
names. Immediately, all the mythical material
vanishes. Thus, "Selene kisses the sleeping
Endymion" becomes the dry formula, "It is night."
The most skilled linguists often declare themselves
unable to change the pliant tongue of the imaginative
age into our algebraic idioms.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Thought by
imagery cannot remain itself and at the same time
take on a rational dress.</p>

<p>The mental state that marks the zenith of the
free development of the imagination, is at present
met with only in mystics and in some poets. Language
has, however, preserved numerous vestiges
of it in current expressions, the mythic signification
of which has been lost&mdash;the sun rises, the sea is
treacherous, the wind is mad, the earth is thirsty,
etc.</p>

<p>To this triumphant period there succeeds among
the races that have made progress in evolution, i.e.,
that have been able to rise above the age of (pure)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
imagination, the period of waning, of regression, of
decline. In order to understand it and perceive the
how and why of it, let us first note that myths are
reducible to two great categories:</p>

<p>a. The explicative myths, arising from utility,
from the necessity of knowing. <i>These undergo a
radical transformation.</i></p>

<p>b. The non-explicative myths, resulting from a
need of luxury, from a pure desire to create: these
undergo only a <i>partial</i> transformation.</p>

<p>Let us follow them in the accomplishment of their
destinies.</p>

<p>a. The myths of the first class, answering the
various needs of knowing in order afterwards to
act, are much the more numerous.... Is
primitive man by nature curious? The question
has been variously answered; thus, Tylor says yes;
Spencer, no.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The affirmative and negative answers
are not, perhaps, irreconcilable, if we take account
of the differences in races. Taking it generally,
it is hard to believe that he is not curious&mdash;he holds
his life at that price. He is in the presence of the
universe just as we are when confronted with an
unknown animal or fruit. Is it useful or hurtful?
He has all the more need for a conception of the
world since he feels himself dependent on everything.
While our subordination as regards nature
is limited by the knowledge of her laws, he is on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
account of his animism in a position similar to ours
before an assembly of persons whom we have to
approach or avoid, conciliate or yield to. It is
necessary that he be <i>practically</i> curious&mdash;that is
indispensable for his preservation. There has been
alleged the indifference of primitive man to the
complicated engines of civilization (a steamboat, a
watch, etc.). This shows, not lack of curiosity, but
absence of intelligence or interest for what he does
not consider immediately useful for his needs.</p>

<p>His conception of the world is a product of the
imagination, because no other is possible for him.
The problem is imperatively set, he solves it as best
he can; the myth is a response to a host of theoretical
and practical needs. For him, the imaginative
explanation takes the place of the rational
explanation which is yet unborn, and which for
great reasons can not arise&mdash;first, because the
poverty of his experience, limited to a small circle,
engenders a multitude of erroneous associations,
which remain unbroken in the absence of other experiences
to contradict and shatter them; secondly,
because of the extreme weakness of his logic and
especially of his conception of causality, which most
often reduces itself to a <i>post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>.
Whence we have the thorough subjectivity of his
interpretation of the world.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In short, primitive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
man makes without exception or reserve, and in
terms of images, what science makes provisionally,
with reserves, and by means of concepts&mdash;namely,
hypotheses.</p>

<p>Thus, the explicative myths are as we see, an
epitome of a practical philosophy, proportioned to
the requirements of the man of the earliest, or
slightly-cultured ages. Then comes the period of
critical transformation: a slow, progressive substitution
of a rational conception of the world for the
imaginative conception. It results from a work of
<i>depersonification</i> of the myth, which little by little
loses its subjective, anthropomorphic character in
order to become all the more objective, without ever
succeeding therein completely.</p>

<p>This transformation occurs thanks to two principal
supports: methodical and prolonged observation
of phenomena, which suggests the objective
notion of stability and law, opposed to the caprices
of animism (example: the work of the ancient
astronomers of the Orient); the growing power of
reflection and of logical rigor, at least in well-endowed
races.</p>

<p>It does not concern the subject in hand to trace
here the fortunes of the old battle whereby the
imagination, assailed by a rival power, loses little
by little its position and preponderance in the interpretation
of the world. A few remarks will suffice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>To begin with, the myth is transformed into
philosophic speculation, but without total disappearance,
as is seen in the mystic speculations of the
Pythagoreans, in the cosmology of Empedocles,
ruled by two human-like antitheses, Love and Hate.
Even to Thales, an observing, positive spirit that
calculates eclipses, the world is full of <i>daemons</i>,
remains of primitive animism.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In Plato, even
leaving out his theory of Ideas, the employment of
myth is not merely a playful mannerism, but a real
survival.</p>

<p>This work of elimination, begun by the philosophers,
is more firmly established in the first attempts
of pure science (the Alexandrian mathematicians;
naturalists like Aristotle; certain Greek physicians).
Nevertheless, we know how imaginary concepts
remained alive in physics, chemistry, biology, down
to the sixteenth century; we know the bitter
struggle that the two following centuries witnessed
against occult qualities and loose methods. Even
in our day, Stallo has been able to propose to write
a treatise "On Myth in Science." Without speaking
at this time of the hypotheses admitted as such and
on account of their usefulness, there yet remain in
the sciences many latent signs of primitive anthropomorphism.
At the beginning of the nineteenth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
century people believed in several "properties of
matter" that we now regard as merely modes of
energy. But this latter notion, an expression of
permanence underneath the various manifestations
of nature, is for science only an abstract, symbolical
formula: if we attempt to embody it, to make
it concrete and representable, then, whether we will
or no, it resolves itself into the feeling of muscular
effort, that is, takes on a human character. To
produce no other examples, we see that so far as
concerns the last term of this slow regression, the
imagination is not yet completely annulled, although
it may have had to recede incessantly before a more
solid and better armed rival.</p>

<p>b. In addition to the explanatory myths, there
are those having no claim to be in this class,
although they have perhaps been originally suggested
by some phenomenon of animate or inanimate
nature. They are much less numerous than
the others, since they do not answer multiple necessities
of life. Such are the epic or heroic stories,
popular tales, romances (which are found as early
as ancient Egypt): it is the first appearance of that
form of esthetic activity destined later to become
literature. Here, the mythic activity suffers only a
superficial metamorphosis&mdash;the essence is not
changed. Literature is mythology transformed and
adapted to the variable conditions of civilization.
If this statement appear doubtful or disrespectful,
we should note the following.</p>

<p>Historically, from myths wherein there figure at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
first only divine personages, there arise the epics of
the Hindoos, Greeks, Scandinavians, etc., in which
the gods and heroes are confounded, live in the
same world, on a level. Little by little the divine
character is rubbed out; the myth approaches the
ordinary conditions of human life, until it becomes
the romantic novel, and finally the realistic story.</p>

<p>Psychologically, the imaginative work that has
at first created the gods and superior beings before
whom man bows because he has unconsciously produced
them, becomes more and more humanized as
it becomes conscious; but it cannot cease being a
projection of the feelings, ideas, and nature of man
into the fictitious beings upon whom the belief of
their creator and of his hearers confers an illusory
and fleeting existence. The gods have become puppets
whose master man feels himself, and whom he
treats as he likes. Throughout the manifold techniques,
esthetics, documentary collections, reproductions
of the social life, the creative activity of the
earliest time remains at bottom unchanged. Literature
is a decadent and rationalized mythology.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Does the mythic activity of ancient times still
exist among civilized peoples, unmodified as in
literary creation, but in its pure form, as a non-individual,
collective, anonymous, unconscious,
work? Yes; as the popular imagination, when
creating legends. In passing from natural phenomena
to historic events and persons, the constructive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>imagination takes a slightly different position
which we may characterize thus: legend is to myth
what illusion is to hallucination.</p>

<p>The psychological mechanism is the same in both
cases. Illusion and legend are partial imaginations,
hallucination and myth are total imaginations. Illusion
may vary in all shades between exact perception
and hallucination; legend can run all the way
from exact history to pure myth. The difference
between illusion and hallucination is sometimes
imperceptible; the same is sometimes true of legend
and myth. Sensory illusion is produced by an
addition of images changing perception; legend is
also produced by an addition of images changing
the historic personage or event. The only difference,
then, is in the material used; in one case, a
datum of sense, a natural phenomenon; in the other,
a fact of history, a human event.</p>

<p>The psychological genesis of legends being thus
established in general, what, according to the facts,
are the unconscious processes that the imagination
employs for creating them? We may distinguish
two principal ones.</p>

<p>The first process is a fusion or combination. The
myth precedes the fact; the historical personage or
event enters into the mould of a pre-existing myth.
"It is necessary that the mythic form be fashioned
before one may pour into it, in a more or less fluid
state, the historic metal." Imagination had created
a solar mythology long before it could be incarnated
by the Greeks in Hercules and his exploits. "There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
was historically a Roland, perhaps even an Arthur,
but the greater part of the great deeds that the
poetry of the Middle Ages attributes to them had
been accomplished long before by mythological
heroes whose very names had been forgotten."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> At
one time the man is completely hidden by the myth
and becomes absolutely legendary; again, he
assumes only an aureole that transfigures him.
This is exactly what occurs in the simpler phenomenon
of sensory illusion: now the real (the
perception) is swamped by the images, is transformed,
and the objective element reduced to almost
nothing; at another time, the objective element
remains master, but with numerous deformations.</p>

<p>The second process is idealization, which can act
conjointly with the other. Popular imagination
incarnates in a real man its ideal of heroism, of
loyalty, of love, of piety, or of cowardice, cruelty,
wickedness, and other abnormalities. The process
is more complex. It presupposes in addition to
mythic creation a labor of abstraction, through
which a dominating characteristic of the historic
personage is chosen and everything else is suppressed,
cast into oblivion: the ideal becomes a
center of attraction about which is formed the
legend, the romantic tale. Compare the Alexander,
the Charlemagne, the Cid of the Middle Age traditions
to the character of history.</p>

<p>Even much nearer to us, this process of extreme
simplification&mdash;which the law of mental inertia or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of least effort is sufficient to explain&mdash;always persists:
Lucretia Borgia remains the type of debauchery,
Henry IV of good fellowship, etc. The protests
of historians and the documentary evidence
that they produce avail nothing: the work of the
imagination resists everything.</p>

<p>To conclude: We have just passed over a period
of mental evolution wherein the creative imagination
reigns exclusively, explains everything, is sufficient
for everything. It has been said that the
imagination is "a temporary derangement." It
seems so to us, although it is often an effort toward
wisdom, i.e., toward the comprehension of things.
It would be more correct to say, with Tylor, that it
represents a state intermediate between that of a
man of our time, prosaic and well-to-do, and that
of a furious madman, or of a man in the delirium
of fever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE HIGHER FORMS OF INVENTION</h3>


<p>We now pass from primitive to civilized man,
from collective to individual creation, the characters
of which it remains for us to study as we find
them in great inventors who exhibit them on a
large scale. Fortunately, we may dismiss the treatment
of the oft-discussed, never-solved problem of
the psychological nature of genius. As we have
already noted, there enter into its composition factors
other than the creative imagination, although
the latter is not the least among them. Besides,
great men being exceptions, anomalies, or as the
current expression has it, "spontaneous variations,"
we may ask <i>in limine</i> whether their psychology is
explicable by means of simple formul&aelig;, as with the
average man, or whether even monographs teach us
no more concerning their nature than general
theories that are never applicable to all cases.
Taking genius, then, as synonymous with great inventor,
accepting it <i>de facto</i> historically and psychologically,
our task is limited to the attempt to separate
characters that seem, from observation and
experiment, to belong to it as peculiarly its own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Putting aside vague dissertations and dithyrambics
in favor of theories with a scientific tendency
as to the nature of genius, we meet first the one
attributing to it a pathological origin. Hinted at
in antiquity (Aristotle, Seneca, etc.), suggested in
the oft-expressed comparison between inspiration
and insanity, it has reached, as we know&mdash;through
timid, reserved, and partial statements (L&eacute;lut)&mdash;its
complete expression in the famous formula of
Moreau de Tours, "Genius is a neurosis."</p>

<p>Neuropathy was for him the exaggeration of vital
properties and consequently the most favorable condition
for the hatching of works of genius. Later,
Lombroso, in a book teeming with doubtful or
manifestly false evidence, finding his predecessor's
theory too vague, attempts to give it more precision
by substituting for neurosis in general a specific
neurosis&mdash;larvated epilepsy. Alienists, far from
eagerly accepting this view, have set themselves to
combat it and to maintain that Lombroso has compromised
everything in wanting to make the term
too precise. There are several possible hypotheses,
they say: either the neuropathic state is the direct,
immediate cause of which the higher faculties of
genius are effects; or, the intellectual superiority,
through the excessive labor and excitation it involves,
causes neuropathic disturbances; or, there
is no relation of cause and effect between genius and
neurosis, but mere co&euml;xistence, since there are found
very mediocre neuropaths, and men above the average
without a neurotic blemish; or, the two states<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&mdash;the
one psychic, the other physiological&mdash;are both
effects, resulting from organic conditions that produce
according to circumstances genius, insanity,
and divers nervous troubles. Every one of these
hypotheses can allege facts in its favor. We must,
however, recognize that in most men of genius are
found so many peculiarities, physical eccentricities
and disorders of all kinds that the pathologic theory
retains much probability.</p>

<p>There remain for consideration the sane geniuses
who, despite many efforts and subtleties, have not
yet been successfully brought under the foregoing
formula, and who have made possible the enunciation
of another theory. Recently, Nordau, rejecting
the theory of his master Lombroso, has maintained
that it is just as reasonable to say that
"genius is a neurosis" as that "athleticism is a
cardiopathy" because many athletes are affected
with heart disease. For him, "the essential elements
of genius are judgment and will." Following
this definition, he establishes the following
hierarchy of men of genius: At the highest rung
of the ladder are those in whom judgment and will
are equally powerful; men of action who make
world-history (Alexander, Cromwell, Napoleon)&mdash;these
are masters of men. On the second level are
found the geniuses of judgment, with no hyper-development
of will&mdash;these are masters of matter
(Pasteur, Helmholtz, R&ouml;ntgen). On the third step
are geniuses of judgment without energetic will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&mdash;thinkers
and philosophers. What then shall we do
with the emotional geniuses&mdash;the poets and artists?
Theirs is not genius in the strict sense, "because it
creates nothing new and exercises no influence on
phenomena." Without discussing the value of this
classification, without examining whether it is even
possible,&mdash;since there is no common measure between
Alexander, Pasteur, Shakespeare, and Spinoza,&mdash;and
whether, on the other hand, common
opinion is not right in putting on the same level
the great creators, whoever they be, solely because
they are far above the average, this remark is absolutely
necessary: In the definition above cited the
creative faculty <i>par excellence</i>&mdash;imagination&mdash;necessary
to all inventors, is entirely left out.</p>

<p>We can, however, derive some benefit from this
arbitrary division. Although it is impossible to
admit that "emotional geniuses" create nothing new
and have no influence on society, they do form a
special group. Creative work requires of them a
nervous excitability and a predominance of affective
states that rapidly become morbid. In this way
they have provided the pathological theory with
most of its facts. It would perhaps be necessary to
recognize distinctions between the various forms of
invention. They require very different organic and
psychic conditions in order that some may profit
by morbid dispositions that are far from useful to
others. This point should deserve a special study
never made hitherto.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<h3>I</h3>

<p>We shall reduce to three the characters ordinarily
met in most great inventors. No one of them is
without exception.</p>

<p>1. <i>Precocity</i>, which is reducible to innateness.
The natural bent becomes manifest as soon as circumstances
allow&mdash;it is the sign of the true vocation.
The story is the same in all cases: at one
moment the flash occurs; but this is not as frequent
as is supposed. False vocations abound. If we
deduct those attracted through imitation, environmental
influence, exhortations and advice, chance,
the attraction of immediate gain, aversion to a
career imposed from without which they shun and
adoption of an opposite one, will there remain many
natural and irresistible vocations?</p>

<p>We have seen above that<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> the passage from reproductive
to constructive imagination takes place
toward the end of the third year. According to
some authors, this initial period should be followed
by a depression about the fifth year; thenceforward
the upward progress is continuous. But the
creative faculty, from its nature and content, develops
in a very clear, chronological order. Music,
plastic arts, poetry, mechanical invention, scientific
imagination&mdash;such is the usual order of appearance.</p>

<p>In music, with the exception of a few child-prodigies,
we hardly find personal creation before the
age of twelve or thirteen. As examples of precocity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
may be cited: Mozart, at the age of three; Mendelssohn,
five; Haydn, four; Handel, twelve; Weber,
twelve; Schubert, eleven; Cherubini, thirteen;
and many others. Those late in developing&mdash;Beethoven,
Wagner, etc.&mdash;are fewer by far.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In the plastic arts, vocation and creative aptitude
are shown perceptibly later, on the average about
the fourteenth year: Giotto, at ten; Van Dyck,
ten; Raphael, eight; Guerchin, eight; Greuze, eight;
Michaelangelo, thirteen; Albrecht D&uuml;rer, fifteen;
Bernini, twelve; Rubens and Jordaens being also
precocious.</p>

<p>In poetry we find no work having any individual
character before sixteen. Chatterton died at that
age, perhaps the only example of so young a poet
leaving any reputation. Schiller and Byron also
began at sixteen. Besides this, we know that the
talent for versification, at least as imitation, is very
early in developing.</p>

<p>In mechanical arts children have early a remarkable
capacity for understanding and imitating. At
nine, Poncelet bought a watch that was out of
order in order to study it, then took it apart and
put it together correctly. Arago tells that at the
same age Fresnel was called by his comrades a
"man of genius," because he had determined by
correct experiments "the length and caliber of children's
elder-wood toy cannon giving the longest
range; also, which green or dry woods used in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
manufacture of bows have most strength and lasting
power." In general, the average of mechanical
invention is later, and scarcely comes earlier than
that of scientific discovery.</p>

<p>The form of abstract imagination requisite for
invention in the sciences has no great personal
value before the twentieth year: there are a goodly
number, however, who have given proof of it before
that age&mdash;Pascal, Newton, Leibniz, Gauss, Auguste
Comte, etc. Almost all are mathematicians.</p>

<p>These chronological variations result not from
chance, but from psychological conditions necessary
for the development of each form of imagination.
We know that the acquisition of musical sounds is
prior to speech: many children can repeat a scale
correctly before they are able to talk. On the other
hand, as dissolution follows evolution in inverse
order,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> aphasic patients lacking the most common
words, can nevertheless sing. Sound-images are
thus organized before all others, and the creative
power when acting in this direction finds very early
material for its use. For the plastic arts a longer
apprenticeship is necessary for the education of the
senses and movements. To acquire manual dexterity
one must become skilled in observing form,
combinations of lines and colors, and apt at reproducing
them. Poetry and first attempts at novel-writing
presuppose some experience of the passions
of human life and a certain reflection of which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
child is incapable. Invention in the mechanic arts,
as in the plastic arts, requires the education of the
senses and movements; and, further, calculation, rational
combination of means, rigorous adaptation to
practical necessities. Lastly, scientific imagination
is nothing without a high development of the
capacity for abstraction, which is a matter of slow
growth. Mathematicians are the most precocious
because their material is the most simple; they have
no need, as in the case of the experimental sciences,
of an extended knowledge of facts, which is
acquired only with time.</p>

<p>At this period of its development the imagination
is in large part imitation. We must explain this
paradox. The creator begins by imitating: this is
such a well-known fact that it is needless to give
proof of it, and it is subject to few exceptions.
The most original mind is, at first, consciously or
unconsciously somebody's disciple. It is necessarily
so. Nature gives only one thing, "the creative instinct;"
that is, the need of producing in a determined
line. This internal factor alone is insufficient.
Aside from the fact that the imagination at
first has at its disposal only a very limited material,
it lacks technique, the processes indispensable for
realizing itself. As long as the creator has not
found the suitable form into which to cast his
creation he must indeed borrow it from another;
his ideas must suffer the necessity of a provisional
shelter. This explains how it is that later the
inventor, reaching full consciousness of himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in order to complete mastery of his methods, often
breaks with his models, and burns what he at first
adorned.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A second character consists of the necessity, the
fatality of creation. Great inventors feel that they
have a task to accomplish; they feel that they are
charged with a mission. On this point we have a
large number of testimonials and avowals. In the
darkest days of his life Beethoven, haunted by the
thought of suicide, wrote, "Art alone has kept me
back. It seemed to me that I could not leave the
world before producing all that I felt within me."
Ordinarily, inventors are apt in only one line; even
when they have a certain versatility, they remain
bound to their own peculiar manner&mdash;they have
their mark&mdash;like Michaelangelo; or, if they attempt
to change it, if they try to be unfaithful as respects
their vocation, they fall much below themselves.</p>

<p>This characteristic of irresistible impulsion which
makes the genius create not because he wants to, but
because he must do it, has often been likened to
instinct. This very widespread view has been examined
before (Part I, <a href="#Page_31">Chapter ii</a>).</p>

<p>We have seen that there is no creative instinct
in general, but <i>particular</i> tendencies, orientated in a
definite direction, which in most respects resemble
instinct. It is contrary to experience and logic to
admit that the creative genius follows any path
whatever at his choice&mdash;a proposition that Weismann,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>in his horror of inheritance of acquired characters
(which are a kind of innateness) is not afraid
to support. That is true only of the man of talent,
a matter of education and circumstances. The distinction
between these two orders of creators&mdash;the
great and the ordinary&mdash;has been made too often
to need repetition, although it is proper to recognize
that it is not always easy in practice, that there are
names that cause us to hesitate, which we class
somewhat at hazard. Yet genius remains, as Schopenhauer
used to say, <i>monstrum per excessum</i>; excessive
development in one direction. Hypertrophy
of a special aptitude often makes genius fall, as far
as the others are concerned, below the average level.
Even those exceptional men who have given proof
of multiple aptitudes, such as Vinci, Michaelangelo,
Goethe, etc., always have a predominating tendency
which, in common opinion, sums them up.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>A third characteristic is the clearly defined <i>individuality</i>
of the great creator. He is the man of
his work; he has done this or that: that is his
mark. He is "representative." There is no other
opinion as to this; what is a subject of discussion
is the <i>origin</i>, not the nature of this individuality.
The Darwinian theory as to the all-powerful action
of environment has led to the question whether the
representative character of great inventors comes
from themselves, and from them alone, or must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
not rather be sought in the unconscious influence of
the race and epoch of which they are at a given
instant only brighter sparks. This debate goes beyond
the bounds of our subject. To decide whether
social changes are due mostly to the accumulated
influences of some individuals and their initiative,
or to the environment, to circumstances, to hereditary
transmission, is not a problem for psychology
to solve. We can not, however, totally avoid this
discussion, for it touches the very springs of creation.</p>

<p>Is the inventive genius the highest degree of personality
or a synthesis of masses?&mdash;the result of
himself or of others?&mdash;the expression of an individual
activity or of a collective activity? In short,
should we look for his representative character
within him or without? Both these alternatives
have authoritative supporters.</p>

<p>For Schopenhauer, Carlyle (<i>Hero-worship</i>),
Nietzsche, <i>et al.</i>, the great man is an autonomous
product, a being without a peer, a demigod, "<i>Uebermensch</i>."
He can be explained neither by heredity,
nor by environment.</p>

<p>For others (Taine, Spencer, Grant, Allen, <i>et al.</i>),
the important factor is seen in the race and external
conditions. Goethe held that a whole family line is
summarized some day in a single one of its members,
and a whole people in one or several men.
For him, Louis XIV and Voltaire are respectively
the French king and writer <i>par excellence</i>. "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
alleged great men," says Tolstoi, "are only the labels
of history, they give their names to events."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Each party explains the same facts according to
its own principle and in its own peculiar way. The
great historic epochs are rich in great men (the
Greek republics of the fourth century B. C., the
Roman Republic, the Renaissance, French Revolution,
etc.). Why? Because, say some, periods put
into ferment by the deep working of the masses
make this blossoming possible. Because, say the
others, this flowering modifies profoundly the social
and intellectual condition of the masses and raises
their level. For the former the ferment is deep
down; for the latter it is on top.</p>

<p>Without presuming to solve this vexed question,
I lean toward the view of individualism pure and
simple. It seems to me very difficult to admit that
the great creator is only the result of his environment.
Since this influence acts on many others,
it is very necessary that, in great men, there should
be in addition a personal factor. Besides, in opposition
to the exclusively environmental theory we
may bring the well-known fact that most innovators
and inventors at first arouse opposition. We
know the invariable sentence on everything novel&mdash;it
is "false" or "bad;" then it is adopted with the
statement that it had been known for a long time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
In the hypothesis of collective invention, it seems
that the mass of people should applaud inventors,
recognizing itself in them, seeing its confused
thought take form and body: but most often the
contrary happens. The misoneism of crowds seems
to me one of the strongest arguments in favor of
the individual character of invention.</p>

<p>We can doubtless distinguish two cases&mdash;in the
first, the creator sums up and clearly translates the
aspirations of his <i>milieu</i>; in the second, he is in
opposition to it because he goes beyond it. How
many innovators have been disappointed because
they came before their time! But this distinction
does not reach to the bottom of the question, and is
not at all sufficient as an answer.</p>

<p>Let us leave this problem, which, on account of
its complexity, we can hardly solve through peremptory
reasoning, and let us try to examine <i>objectively</i>
the relation between creation and environment in
order that we may see to what extent the creative
imagination, without losing its individual character&mdash;which
is impossible&mdash;depends on the intellectual
and social surrounding.</p>

<p>If, with the American psychologists,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> we term
the disposition for innovating a "spontaneous variation"&mdash;a
Darwinian term explaining nothing, but
convenient&mdash;we may enunciate the following law:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The tendency toward spontaneous variation (invention)
is always in inverse ratio to the simplicity
of the environment.</i></p>

<p>The savage environment is in its nature very
simple, consequently homogeneous. The lower races
show a much smaller degree of differentiation than
the higher; in them, as Jastrow says, physical and
psychic maturity is more precocious, and as the
period just before the adult age is the plastic period
<i>per se</i>, this diminishes the chances of a departure
from the common type. Thus comparison between
whites and blacks, between primitive and civilized
peoples, shows that, for equal populations, there is
an enormous disproportion as to the number of
innovators.</p>

<p>The barbarian environment is much more complex
and heterogeneous: it contains all the rudiments
of civilized life. Consequently, it favors
more individual variations and is richer in superior
men. But these variations are rarely produced outside
of a very restricted field&mdash;political, military,
religious. So it seems impossible to agree with
Joly<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that neither primitive nor barbarian peoples
produce superior minds, "unless," as he says, "by
this name we mean those that simply surpass
their congeners." But is there a criterion other
than that? I see none. Greatness is altogether a
relative idea; and would not our great creators
seem, to beings better endowed than we, very small?</p>

<p>The civilized environment, requiring division of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
labor and consequently a constantly growing complexity
of heterogeneous elements, is an open door
for all vocations. Doubtless, the social spirit always
retains something of that tendency toward stagnation
that is the rule in lower social orders; it is
more favorable to tradition than to innovation. But
the inevitable necessity of a warm competition between
individuals and peoples is a natural antidote
for that natural inertia; it favors useful variations.
Moreover, civilization means evolution; consequently
the conditions under which the imagination
is active change with the times. Let us suppose,
Weismann justly says, that in the Samoan
Islands there were born a child having the singular
and extraordinary genius of Mozart. What could
he accomplish? At the most, extend the gamut of
three or four tones to seven, and create a few more
complex melodies; but he would be as unable to
compose symphonies as Archimedes would have
been to invent an electric dynamo. How many
creators have been wrecked because the conditions
necessary for their inventions were lacking? Roger
Bacon foresaw several of our great discoveries;
Cardan, the differential calculus; Van Helmont,
chemistry; and it has been possible to write a book
on the forerunners of Darwin.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> We talk so much
of the free flight of imagination, of the all-comprehensive
power of the creator, that we forget the
sociological conditions&mdash;not to mention others&mdash;on
which they are every moment dependent. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
this respect, no invention is personal in the strict
sense; there always remains in it a little of that
anonymous collaboration the highest expression of
which, as we have seen, is the mythic activity.</p>

<p>By way of summary, and whatever be the causes,
we may say that there is a universal tendency in
all living matter toward variation, whether we consider
vegetables, animals, or the physical and mental
man. The need of innovating is only a special
case, rare in the lower races, frequent in the higher.
This tendency toward variation is fundamental or
superficial: As fundamental, it corresponds to
genius, and survives through processes analogous
to natural selection, i.e., by its own power. As
superficial, it corresponds to talent, survives and
prospers chiefly through the help of circumstances
and environment. Here, the orientation comes
from without, not from within. According as the
spirit of the time inclines rather to poetry or painting,
or music, or scientific research, or industry, or
military art, minds of the second order are dragged
into the current&mdash;showing that a goodly part of
their power is in the aptness, not for invention, but
for <i>imitation</i>.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The determination of the characters belonging to
the inventive genius has necessitated some seemingly
irrelevant remarks on the action of the environment.
Let us return to invention, strictly
so-called.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>For inventing there is always required a natural
aptitude, sometimes, a happy chance.</p>

<p>The natural disposition should be accepted as a
fact. Why does a man create? Because he is
capable of forming new combinations of ideas.
However na&iuml;ve this answer may be, there is no
other. The only thing possible, is the determination
of the conditions necessary and sufficient for producing
novel combinations: this has been done in
the first part of this book, and there is no occasion
for going over it again. But there is another
aspect in creative work to be considered&mdash;its psychological
<i>mechanism</i>, and the form of its development.</p>

<p>Every normal person creates little or much.
He may, in his ignorance, invent what has been
already done a thousand times. Even if this is not
a creation as regards the species, it is none the less
such for the individual. It is wrong to say, as has
been said, that an invention "is a new and important
idea." <i>Novelty</i> only is essential&mdash;that is the
psychological mark: importance and utility are accessory,
merely social marks. Invention is thus
unduly limited when we attribute it to great inventors
only. At this moment, however, we are concerned
only with these, and in them the mechanism
of invention is easier to study.</p>

<p>We have already seen how false is the theory
that holds that there is always a sudden stroke of
inspiration, followed by a period of rapid or slow
execution. On the contrary, observation reveals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
many processes that apparently differ less in the
<i>content</i> of invention than according to individual
temperament. I distinguish two general processes
of which the rest are variations. In all creation,
great or small, there is a directing idea, an "ideal"&mdash;understanding
the word not in its transcendental
sense, but merely as synonymous with end or goal&mdash;or
more simply, a problem to solve. The <i>locus</i> of
the idea, of the given problem, is not the same in
the two processes. In the one I term "complete"
the ideal is at the beginning: in the "abridged" it is
in the middle. There are also other differences
which the following tables will make more clear:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="8" summary="first process">
<tr><td colspan='3'><i>First Process</i> (<i>complete</i>).</td></tr>
<tr><td align='center'>1st phase</td><td align='center'>2nd phase</td><td align='center'>3d phase</td></tr>
<tr><td class='firstp'>IDEA (commencement)<br />

DISCOVERY<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(end)</td>
<td class='firstp'>VERIFICATION,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or<br />
APPLICATION</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The idea excites attention and takes a fixed character.
The period of brooding begins. For Newton
it lasted seventeen years, and at the time of definitely
establishing his discovery by calculation he
was so overcome with emotion that he had to assign
to another the task of completing it. The mathematician
Hamilton tells us that his method of quaternians
burst upon him one day, completely finished,
while he was near a bridge in Dublin. "In
that moment I had the result of fifteen years' labor."
Darwin gathers material during his voyages, spends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a long time observing plants and animals, then
through the chance reading of Malthus' book, hits
upon and formulates his theory. In literary and
artistic creation similar examples are frequent.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The second phase is only an instant, but essential&mdash;the
moment of discovery, when the creator
exclaims his "Eureka!"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> With it, the work is virtually
or really ended.</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="8" summary="secondprocess">
<tr><td colspan='3'><i>Second Process</i> (<i>abridged</i>).</td></tr>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;period.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>This is the process in intuitive minds. Such
seems to have been the case of Mozart, Poe, etc.
Without attempting what would be a tedious
enumeration of examples, we may say that this
form of creation comprises two classes&mdash;those
coming to maturity through an internal impulse,
a sudden stroke of inspiration, and those who are
suddenly illumined by chance. The two processes
differ superficially rather than essentially. Let us
briefly compare them.</p>

<p>With some, the first phase is long and fully conscious;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>in others it seems negligible, equal to zero&mdash;there
is nothing of it because there exists a natural
or acquired tendency toward equilibrium. "For a
long time," says Schumann, "I had the habit of
racking my brain, and now I scarcely need to scratch
my forehead. Everything runs naturally."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The second phase is almost the same in both
cases: it is only an instant, but it is essential&mdash;it
is the moment of imaginative synthesis.</p>

<p>Lastly, the third phase is very short for some,
because the main labor is already done, and there
remains only the finishing touch or the verification.
It is long for others, because they must pass from
the perceived idea to complete realization, and because
the preparatory work is faulty; so that for
these the second creative process is shortened in
appearance only.</p>

<p>Such seem to me the two principal forms of the
mechanism of creation. These are genera; they
include species and varieties that a patient and
minute study of the processes peculiar to various
inventors would reveal to us. We must bear in
mind that this work makes no claim of being a
monograph on invention, but merely a sketch.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The two processes above described seem to correspond
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>on the whole to the oft-made distinction between
the intuitive or spontaneous, and the combining
or reflective imagination.</p>

<p>The intuitive, essentially synthetic form, is found
principally in the purely imaginative types, children
and savages. The mind proceeds from the whole
to details. The generative idea resembles those concepts
which, in the sciences, are of wide range
because they condense a generalization rich in consequences.
The subject is at first comprehended as
a whole; development is organic, and we may compare
it to the embryological process that causes a
living being to arise from the fertilized ovum,
analogous to an immanent logic. As a type of this
creative form there has often been given a letter
wherein Mozart explains his mode of conception.
Recently (and that is why I do not reprint it here)
it has been suspected of being apocryphal. I regret
this&mdash;it was worthy of being authentic. According
to Goethe, Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i> could have been
created only through an intuitive process, etc.</p>

<p>The combining, discursive imagination proceeds
from details to the vaguely-perceived unity. It
starts from a fragment that serves as a matrix, and
becomes completed little by little. An adventure, an
anecdote, a scene, a rapid glance, a detail, suggests
a literary or artistic creation; but the organic form
does not appear in a trice. In science, Kepler furnishes
a good example of this combining imagination.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>It is known that he devoted a part of his
life trying strange hypotheses, until the day when,
having discovered the elliptical orbit of Mars, all
his former work took shape and became an organized
system. Did we want to make use once more
of an embryological comparison, it would be necessary
to look for it in the strange conceptions of
ancient cosmogonies: they believed that from an
earthly slime arose parts of bodies and separate
organs which through a mysterious attraction and
happy chance ended by sticking together, and forming
living bodies.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>It is an accepted view that of these two modes,
one, the abridged or intuitive process, is superior to
the other. I confess to having held this prejudice.
On examination, I find it doubtful, even false.
There is a <i>difference</i>, not any "higher" and "lower."</p>

<p>First of all, both these forms of creation are
necessary. The intuitive process can suffice for an
invention of short duration: a rhyme, a story, a
profile, a <i>motif</i>, an ornamental stroke, a little
mechanical contrivance, etc. But as soon as the
work requires time and development the discursive
process becomes absolutely necessary: with many
inventors one easily perceives the change from one
form to the other. We have seen that in the case
of Chopin, "creation was spontaneous, miraculous,"
coming complete and sudden. But George Sand
adds: "The crisis over, then commenced the most
heartrending labor at which I have ever been present,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>and she pictures him to us agonized, for days
and weeks, running after the bits of lost inspiration.
Goethe, likewise, in a letter to Humboldt regarding
his Faust, which occupied him for sixty years, full
of interruptions and gaps: "The difficulty has been
to get through strength of will what is really to be
gotten only by a spontaneous act of nature." Zola,
according to his biographer, Toulouse, "imagines a
novel, always starting out with a general idea that
dominates the work; then, from induction to induction,
he draws out of it the characters and all the
story."</p>

<p>To sum up: Pure intuition and pure combination
are exceptional; ordinarily, it is a mixed process in
which one of the two elements prevails and permits
its qualification. If we note, in addition, that it
would be easy to group under these two headings
names of the first rank, we shall conclude that the
difference is altogether in the <i>mechanism</i>, not in the
<i>nature</i> of creation, and is consequently accessory;
and that this difference is reducible to natural dispositions,
which we may contrast as follows:</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>"Were we to raise monuments to inventors in
the arts and sciences, there would be fewer statues
to men than to children, animals, and especially
<i>fortune</i>." In this wise expressed himself one of
the sage thinkers of the eighteenth century, Turgot.
The importance of the last factor has been much
exaggerated. Chance may be taken in two senses&mdash;one
general, the other narrow.</p>

<p>(1) In its broad meaning, chance depends on
entirely internal, purely psychic circumstances. We
know that one of the best conditions for inventing
is abundance of material, accumulated experience,
knowledge&mdash;which augment the chances of original
association of ideas. It has even been possible to
maintain that the nature of memory implies the
capacity of creating in a special direction. The revelations
of inventors or of their biographers leave no
doubt as to the necessity of a large number of
sketches, trials, preliminary drawings, no matter
whether it is a matter of industry, commerce, a machine,
a poem, an opera, a picture, a building, a
plan of campaign, etc. "Genius for discovery,"
says Jevons, depends on the number of notions and
chance thoughts coming to the inventor's mind. To
be fertile in hypotheses&mdash;that is the first requirement
for finding something new. The inventor's brain
must be full of forms, of melodies, of mechanical
agents, of commercial combinations, of figures, etc.,
according to the nature of his work. "But it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
very rare that the ideas we find are exactly those
we were seeking. In order to find, <i>we must think
along other lines</i>."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Nothing is more true.</p>

<p>So much for chance within: it is indisputable,
whatever may have been said of it, but it depends
finally on individuality&mdash;from it arises the non-anticipated
synthesis of ideas. The abundance of
memory-ideas, we know, is not a sufficient condition
for creation; it is not even a necessary condition.
It has been remarked that a relative ignorance
is sometimes useful for invention: it favors assurance.
There are inventions, especially scientific and
industrial, that could not have been made had the
inventors been arrested by the ruling and presumably
invincible dogmas. The inventor was all the
more free the more he was unaware of them. Then,
as it was quite necessary to bow before the accomplished
fact, theory was broadened to include the
new discovery and explain it.</p>

<p>(2) Chance, in the narrow sense, is a fortunate
occurrence stimulating invention: but to attribute to
it the greater part, is a partial, erroneous view.
Here, what we call chance, is the meeting and convergence
of <i>two</i> factors&mdash;one internal (individual
genius), the other, external (the fortuitous occurrence).</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine all that invention
owes to chance in this sense. In primitive humanity
its influence must have been enormous: the use of
fire, the manufacture of weapons, of utensils, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
casting of metals: all that came about through accidents
as simple as, for example, a tree falling across
a stream suggesting the first idea of a bridge.</p>

<p>In historic times&mdash;and to keep merely to the
modern period&mdash;the collection of authentic facts
would fill a large volume. Who does not know of
Newton's apple, Galileo's lamp, Galvani's frog?
Huygens declared that, were it not for an unforeseen
combination of circumstances, the invention of
the telescope would require "a superhuman genius;"
it is known that we owe it to children who were
playing with pieces of glass in an optician's shop.
Sch&ouml;nbein discovered ozone, thanks to the phosphorous
odor of air traversed by electric sparks.
The discoveries of Grimaldi and of Fresnel in regard
to interferences, those of Faraday, of Arago,
of Foucault, of Fraunhofer, of Kirchoff, and of
hundreds of others owed something to "fortune."
It is said that the sight of a crab suggested to Watt
the idea of an ingenious machine. To chance, also,
many poets, novelists, dramatists, and artists have
owed the best part of their inspirations: literature
and the arts abound in fictitious characters whose
real originals are known.</p>

<p>So much for the external, fortuitous factor; its
r&ocirc;le is clear. That of the internal factor is less so.
It is not at all apparent to the ordinary mind, escaping
the unreflecting. Yet it is extremely important.
The same fortuitous event passes by millions of
men without exciting anything. How many of
Pisa's inhabitants had seen the lamp of their cathedral
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>before Galileo! He does not necessarily find
who wants to find. The happy chance comes only
to those worthy of it. In order to profit thereby,
one must first possess the spirit of observation, wide-awake
attention, that isolates and fixates the accident;
then, if it is a matter of scientific or practical
inventions, the penetration that seizes upon relations
and finds unforeseen resemblances; if it concerns
esthetic productions, the imagination that constructs,
organizes, gives life.</p>

<p>Without repeating an evident truism, although it
is often misunderstood, we ought to end by remarking
that <i>chance is an occasion for, not an agent of,
creation</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>LAW OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMAGINATION</h3>


<p>Is imagination, so often called "a capricious
faculty," subject to some law? The question thus
asked is too simple, and we must make it more
precise.</p>

<p>As the direct cause of invention, great or small,
the imagination acts without assignable determination;
in this sense it is what is known as "spontaneity"&mdash;a
vague term, which we have attempted
to make clear. Its appearance is irreducible to any
law; it results from the often fortuitous convergence
of various factors previously studied.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the moment of origin, does the
inventive power, considered in its individual and
specific development, seem to follow any law, or, if
this term appear too ambitious, does it present, in
the course of its evolution, any perceptible regularity?
Observation separates out an empirical law;
that is, extracts directly an abridged formula that
is only a condensation of facts. We may enunciate
it thus: The creative imagination in its complete
development passes through two periods separated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
by a critical phase: a period of autonomy or efflorescence,
a critical moment, a period of definitive constitution
presenting several aspects.</p>

<p>This formula, being only a summary of experience,
should be justified and explained by the latter.
For this purpose we can borrow facts from two distinct
sources: (a) individual development, which is
the safest, clearest, and easiest to observe; (b) the
development of the species, or historical development,
according to the accepted principle that phylogenesis
and ontogenesis follow the same general
line.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p><i>First Period.</i> We are already acquainted with
it: it is the imaginative age. In normal man, it
begins at about the age of three, and embraces infancy,
adolescence, youth: sometimes a longer,
sometimes a shorter period. Play, romantic invention,
mythic and fantastic conceptions of the world
sum it up first; after that, in most, imagination is
dependent on the influence of the passions, and
especially sexual love. For a long time it remains
without any rational element.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, little by little, the latter wins a
place. Reflection&mdash;including under the term the
working of the intelligence&mdash;begins very late, grows
slowly, and the proportion as it asserts itself, gains
an influence over the imaginative activity and tends
to reduce it. This growing antagonism is represented
in the following figure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>The curve IM is that of the imagination during
this first period. It rises at first very slowly, then
attains a rapid ascent and keeps at a height that
marks its greatest attainment in this earliest form.
The dotted line RX represents the rational development
that begins later, advances much more slowly,
but progressively, and reaches at X the level of the
imaginative curve. The two intellectual forms are
present like two rivals. The position MX on the
ordinate marks the beginning of the second period.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/fig003.jpg" width="400" height="181" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Second Period.</i> This is a critical period of indeterminate
length, in any case, always much briefer
than the other two. This critical moment can be
characterized only by its causes and results. Its
causes are, in the physiological sphere, the formation
of an organism and a fully developed brain; in
the psychologic order, the antagonism between the
pure subjectivity of the imagination and the objectivity
of ratiocinative processes; in other words,
between mental instability and stability. As for
the results, they appear only in the third period, the
resultant of this obscure, metamorphic stage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Third Period.</i> It is definite: in some way or
another and in some degree the imagination has become
rationalized, but this change is not reducible
to a single formula.</p>

<p>(1) The creative imagination falls, as is indicated
in the figure, where the imagination curve
MN&acute; descends rapidly toward the line of abcissas
without ever reaching it. This is the most general
case; only truly imaginative minds are exceptions.
One falls little by little into the prose of practical
life&mdash;such is the downfall of love which is treated
as a phantom, the burial of the dreams of youth,
etc. This is a regression, not an end; for the creative
imagination disappears completely in no man;
it only becomes accessory.</p>

<p>(2) It keeps up but becomes transformed; it
adapts itself to the conditions of rational thought;
it is no longer pure imagination, but becomes a
mixed form&mdash;the fact is indicated in the diagram
by the union of the two lines, MN, the imagination,
and XO, the rational. This is the case with truly
imaginative beings, in whom inventive power long
remains young and fresh.</p>

<p>This period of preservation, of definitive constitution
with rational transformation, presents several
varieties. First, and simplest, <i>transformation into
logical form</i>. The creative power manifested in
the first stage remains true to itself, and always follows
the same trend. Such are the precocious inventors,
those whose vocation appeared early and
never changed direction. Invention loses its childish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
or juvenile character in becoming virile; there are
no other changes. Compare Schiller's <i>Robbers</i>,
written in his teens, with his <i>Wallenstein</i>, dating
from his fortieth year; or the vague sketches of
the adolescent James Watt with his inventions as a
man.</p>

<p>Another case is the <i>metamorphosis</i> or <i>deviation</i>
of creative power. We know what numbers of men
who have left a great name in science, politics, mechanical
or industrial invention started out with
mediocre efforts in music, painting, and especially
poetry, the drama, and fiction. The imaginative
impulse did not discover its true direction at the outset;
it imitated while trying to invent. What has
been said above concerning the chronological development
of the imagination would be tiresome repetition.
The need of creating followed from the first
the line of least resistance, where it found certain
materials ready to hand. But in order to arrive
to full consciousness of itself it needed more time,
more knowledge, more accumulated experience.</p>

<p>We might here ask whether the contrary case is
also met with; i.e., where the imagination, in this
third period, would return to the inclinations of the
first period. This regressive metamorphosis&mdash;for I
cannot style it otherwise&mdash;is rare but not without
examples. Ordinarily the creative imagination,
when it has passed its adult stage, becomes attenuated
by slow atrophy without undergoing serious
change of form. Nevertheless, I am able to cite the
case of a well-known scholar who began with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
taste for art, especially plastic art, went over rapidly
to literature, devoted his life to biologic studies,
in which he gained a very deserved reputation; then,
in turn, became totally disgusted with scientific research,
came back to literature and finally to the
arts, which have entirely monopolized him.</p>

<p>Finally&mdash;for there are very many forms&mdash;in some
the imagination, though strong, scarcely passes beyond
the first stage, always retains its youthful, almost
childish form, hardly modified by a minimum
of rationality. Let us note that it is not a question
here of the characteristic ingenuousness of some inventors,
which has caused them to be called "grown-up
children," but of the candor and inherent simplicity
of the imagination itself. This exceptional
form is hardly reconcilable except with esthetic creation.
Let us add the mystic imagination. It could
furnish examples, less in its religious conceptions,
which are without control, than in its reveries of a
scientific turn. Contemporary mystics have invented
adaptations of the world that take us back to the
mythology of early times. This prolonged childhood
of the imagination, which is, in a word, an
anomaly, produces curiosities rather than lasting
works.</p>

<p>At this third period in the development of the
imagination appears a second, subsidiary law, that of
<i>increasing complexity</i>; it follows a progressive line
from the simple to the complex. Indeed, it is not,
strictly speaking, a law of the imagination but of
the rational development exerting an influence on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
it by a counter-action. It is a law of the mind that
<i>knows</i>, not of one that <i>imagines</i>.</p>

<p>It is needless to show that theoretical and practical
intelligence develops as an increasing complex. But
from the time that the mind distinguishes clearly
between the possible and the impossible, between the
fancied and the real&mdash;which is a capacity wanting
in primitive man&mdash;as soon as man has formed rational
habits and has undergone experience the impress
of which is ineffaceable, the creative imagination
is subject, <i>nolens volens</i>, to new conditions;
it is no longer absolute mistress of itself, it has lost
the assurance of its infancy, and is under the rules
of logical thought, which draws it along in its train.
Aside from the exceptions given above&mdash;and even
they are partial exceptions only&mdash;creative power depends
on the ability to understand, which imposes
upon it its form and developmental law. In literature
and in the arts comparison between the simplicity
of primitive creations and the complexity of
advanced civilizations has become commonplace. In
the practical, technical, scientific and social worlds
the higher up we go the more we have to know in
order to create, and in default of this condition we
merely repeat when we think we are inventing.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Historically considered, in the species, the development
of the imagination follows the same line of
progress as in the individual. We will not repeat
it; it would be mere reiteration in a vaguer form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of what we have just said. A few brief notes will
suffice.</p>

<p>Vico&mdash;whose name deserves to be mentioned here
because he was the first to see the good that we can
get from myths for the study of the imagination&mdash;divided
the course of humanity into three successive
ages: divine or theocratic, heroic or fabulous, human
or historic, after which the cycle begins over
again. Although this too hypothetic conception is
now forgotten, it is sufficient for our purposes.
What, indeed, are those first two stages that have
everywhere and always been the harbingers and preparers
of civilization, if not the triumphant period
of the imagination? It has produced myths, religions,
legends, epics and martial narratives, and
imposing monuments erected in honor of gods and
heroes. Many nations whose evolution has been incomplete
have not gone beyond this stage.</p>

<p>Let us now consider this question under a more
definite, more limited, better known form&mdash;the history
of intellectual development in Europe since the
fall of the Roman Empire. It shows very distinctly
our three periods.</p>

<p>No one will question the preponderance of the
imagination during the middle Ages: intensity of
religious feeling, ceaselessly repeated epidemics of
superstition; the institution of chivalry, with all its
accessories; heroic poetry, chivalric romances; courts
of love, efflorescence of Gothic art, the beginning
of modern music, etc. On the other hand, the <i>quantity</i>
of imagination applied during this epoch to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
practical, industrial, commercial invention is very
small. Their scientific culture, buried in Latin
jargon, is made up partly of antique traditions, partly
of fancies; what the ten centuries added to positive
science is almost <i>nil</i>. Our figure, with its two
curves, one imaginative, the other rational, thus applies
just as well to historical development as to individual
development during this first period.</p>

<p>No more will anyone question that the Renaissance
is a critical moment, a transition period, and a
transformation analogous to that which we have
noted in the individual, when there rises, opposed
to imagination, a rival power.</p>

<p>Finally, it will be admitted without dissent that
during the modern period social imagination has become
partly decayed, partly rationalized, under the
influence of two principal factors&mdash;one scientific, the
other economic. On the one hand the development
of science, on the other hand the great maritime discoveries,
by stimulating industrial and commercial
inventions, have given the imagination a new field
of activity. There have arisen points of attraction
that have drawn it into other paths, have imposed
upon it other forms of creation that have often
been neglected or misunderstood and that we shall
study in the Third Part.</p>

<h3>THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF IMAGINATION</h3>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<h2>PRELIMINARY</h2>


<p>After having studied the creative imagination in
its constitutive elements and in its development we
purpose, in this last part, describing its principal
forms. This will be neither analytic nor genetic but
concrete. The reader need not fear wearisome repetition;
our subject is sufficiently complex to permit
a third treatment without reiteration.</p>

<p>The expression "creative imagination," like all
general terms, is an abbreviation and an abstraction.
There is no "imagination in general," but only <i>men
who imagine</i>, and who do so in different ways; the
reality is in them. The diversities in creation, however
numerous, should be reducible to types that are
<i>varieties</i> of imagination, and the determination of
these varieties is analogous to that of character as related
to will. Indeed, when we have settled upon the
physiological and psychological conditions of voluntary
activity we have only done a work in <i>general</i>
psychology. Men being variously constituted, their
modes of action bear the stamp of their individuality;
in each one there is a personal factor that, whatever
its ultimate nature, puts its mark on the will
and makes it energetic or weak, rapid or slow, stable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
or unstable, continuous or intermittent. The same
is true of the creative imagination. We cannot
know it completely without a study of its varieties,
without a special psychology, toward which the following
chapters are an attempt.</p>

<p>How are we to determine these varieties? Many
will be inclined to think that the method is indicated
in advance. Have not psychologists distinguished,
according as one or another of image-groups preponderates,
visual, auditory, motor and mixed
types? Is not the way clear and is it not well
enough to go in this direction? However natural
this solution may appear, it is illusory and can lead
to naught. It rests on the equivocal use of the
word "imagination," which at one time means mere
reproduction of images, and at another time creative
activity, and which, consequently, keeps up the erroneous
notion that in the creative imagination
images, the raw materials, are the essential part. The
materials, no doubt, are not a negligible element,
but by themselves they cannot reveal to us the
species and varieties that have their origin in an
anterior and superior tendency of mind. We shall
see in the sequel that the very nature of constructive
imagination may express itself indifferently in
sounds, words, colors, lines, and even numbers. The
method that should allege to settle the various
orientations of creative activity according to the
nature of images would no more go to the bottom
of the matter than would a classification of architecture
according to the materials employed (as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
rock, brick, iron, wood, etc.) with no regard for
differences of style.</p>

<p>This method aside, since the determination must
be made according to the individuality of the architect,
what method shall we follow? The matter is
even more perplexing than the study of character.
Although various authors have treated the latter
subject (we have attempted it elsewhere), no one
of the proposed classifications has been universally
accepted. Nevertheless, despite their differences,
they coincide in several points, because these have
the advantage of resting on a common basis&mdash;the
large manifestations of human nature, feeling, doing,
thinking. In our subject I find nothing like
this and I seek in vain for a point of support. Classifications
are made according to the essential dominating
attributes; but, as regards the varieties of the
creative imagination, what are they?</p>

<p>We may, indeed, as was said above, distinguish
two great classes&mdash;the intuitive and the combining.
From another point of view we may distinguish
invention of free range (esthetic, religious, mystic)
from invention more or less restricted (mechanical,
scientific, commercial, military, political, social).
But these two divisions are too general, leading to
nothing. A true classification should be in touch
with facts, and this one soars too high.</p>

<p>Leaving, then, to others, more skilled or more
fortunate, the task of a rational and systematic determination,
if it be possible, we shall try merely to
distinguish and describe the principal forms, such as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
experience gives them to us, emphasizing those that
have been neglected or misinterpreted. What follows
is thus neither a classification nor even a complete
enumeration.</p>

<p>We shall study at first two general forms of the
creative imagination&mdash;the plastic and the diffluent&mdash;and
later, special forms, determined by their content
and subject.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Wundt, in a little-noticed passage of his <i>Physiological
Psychology</i>, has undertaken to determine the
composition of the "principal forms of talent,"
which he reduces to four:</p>

<p>The first element is imagination. It may be intuitive,
"that is, conferring on representations a
clearness of sense-perception," or combining; "then
it operates on multiple combinations of images." A
very marked development in both directions at the
same time is uncommon; the author assigns reasons
for this.</p>

<p>The second element is understanding (<i>Verstand</i>).
It may be inductive&mdash;i.e., inclining toward the collection
of facts in order to draw generalizations
from them&mdash;or deductive, taking general concepts
and laws to trace their consequences.</p>

<p>If the intuitive imagination is joined to the inductive
spirit we have the talent for observation of
the naturalist, the psychologist, the pedagogue, the
man of affairs.</p>

<p>If the intuitive imagination is combined with the
deductive spirit we have the analytical talent of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
systematic naturalist, of the geometrician. In Linnaeus
and Cuvier the intuitive element predominates;
in Gauss, the analytical element.</p>

<p>The combining imagination joined to the inductive
spirit constitutes "the talent for invention strictly
so-called," in industry, in the technique of science;
it gives the artist and the poet the power of composing
their works.</p>

<p>The combining imagination plus the deductive
spirit gives the speculative talent of the mathematician
and philosopher; deduction predominates in
the former, imagination in the latter.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE PLASTIC IMAGINATION</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>By "plastic imagination" I understand that which
has for its special characters clearness and precision
of form; more explicitly those forms whose materials
are clear images (whatever be their nature),
approaching perception, giving the impression of
reality; in which, too, there predominate <i>associations
with objective relations</i>, determinable with precision.
The plastic mark, therefore, is in the images, and in
the modes of association of images. In somewhat
rough terms, requiring modifications which the
reader himself can make, it is the imagination that
materializes.</p>

<p>Between perception&mdash;a very complex synthesis of
qualities, attributes and relations&mdash;and conception&mdash;which
is only the consciousness of a quality, quantity,
or relation, often of only a single word accompanied
by vague outlines and a latent, potential
knowledge; between concrete and abstract, the
image occupies an intermediate position and can run
from one pole to another, now full of reality, now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
almost as poor and pale as a concept. The representation
here styled plastic descends towards its
point of origin; it is an external imagination, arising
from sensation rather than from feeling and needing
to become objective.</p>

<p>Thus its general characters are easy of determination.
First and foremost, it makes use of visual
images; then of motor images; lastly, in practical
invention, of tactile images. In a word, the three
groups of images present to a great extent the
character of externality and objectivity. The clearness
of form of these three groups proceeds from
their origin, because they arise from sensation well
determined in space&mdash;sight, movement, touch. Plastic
imagination depends most on spatial conditions.
We shall see that its opposite, diffluent imagination,
is that which depends least upon that factor, or is
most free from it. Among these naturally objective
elements the plastic imagination chooses the most
objective, which fact gives its creations an air of
reality and life.</p>

<p>The second characteristic is inferiority of the affective
element; it appears only intermittently and is
entirely blotted out before sensory impression. This
form of the creative imagination, coming especially
from sensation, aims especially at sensation. Thus
it is rather superficial, greatly devoid of that internal
mark that comes from feeling.</p>

<p>But if it chance that both sensory and affective
elements are equal in power; if there is at the same
time intense vision adequate to reality, and profound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
emotion, violent shock, then there arise extraordinary
imaginative personages, like Shakespeare, Carlyle,
Michelet. It is needless to describe this form
of imagination, excellent pen-pictures of which have
been given by the critics;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> let us merely note that its
psychology reduces itself to an alternately ascending
and descending movement between the two limiting
points of perception and idea. The ascending process
assigns to inanimate objects life, desires and feelings.
Thus Michelet: "The great streams of the
Netherlands, <i>tired</i> with their very long course, <i>perish</i>
as though from <i>weariness</i> in the <i>unfeeling</i>
ocean."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Elsewhere, the great folio begets the octavo,
"which becomes the parent of the small volume,
of booklets, of ephemeral pamphlets, invisible
spirits flying in the night, creating under the very
eyes of tyrants the circulation of liberty." The descending
process materializes abstractions, gives
them body, makes them flesh and bone; the Middle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Ages become "a poor child, torn from the bowels
of Christianity, born amidst tears, grown up in
prayer and revery, in anguish of heart, dying without
achieving anything." In this dazzle of images
there is a momentary return to primitive animism.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>In order to more fully understand the plastic imagination,
let us take up its principal manifestations.</p>

<p>1. First, the arts dealing with form, where its
necessity is evident. The sculptor, painter, architect,
must have visual and tactile-motor images; it
is the material in which their creations are wrapped
up. Even leaving out the striking acts requiring
such a sure and tenacious external vision (portraits
executed from memory, exact remembrance of faces
at the end of twenty years, as in the case of Gavarni,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>), and limiting ourselves merely to the
usual, the plastic arts demand an observant imagination.
For the majority of men the concrete image
of a face, a form, a color, usually remains vague and
fleeting; "red, blue, black, white, tree, animal, head,
mouth, arm, etc., are scarcely more than words, symbols
expressing a rough synthesis. For the painter,
on the other hand, images have a very high precision
of details, and what he sees beneath the words or
in real objects are analyzed facts, positive elements
of perception and movement."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p><p>The r&ocirc;le of tactile-motor images is not insignificant.
There has often been cited the instance of
sculptors who, becoming blind, have nevertheless
been able to fashion busts of close resemblance to
the original. This is memory of touch and of the
muscular sense, entirely equivalent to the visual
memory of the portrait painters mentioned above.
Practical knowledge of design and modeling&mdash;i.e.,
of contour and relief&mdash;though resulting from natural
or acquired disposition, depends on cerebral
conditions, the development of definite sensory-motor
regions and their connections; and on psychological
conditions&mdash;the acquisition and organization
of appropriate images. "We learn to paint and
carve," wrote a contemporary painter, "as we do
sewing, embroidery, sawing, filing and turning."
In short, like all manual labor requiring associated
and combined acts.</p>

<p>2. Another form of plastic imagination uses
words as means for evoking vivid and clear impressions
of sight, touch, movement; it is the poetic or
literary form. Of it we find in Victor Hugo a finished
type. As all know, we need only open his
works at hazard to find a stream of glittering images.
But what is their nature? His recent biographers,
guided by contemporary psychology, have well
shown that they always paint scenes or movements.
It is unnecessary to give proofs. Some facts have
a broader range and throw light upon his psychology.
Thus we are told that "he never dictates or
rhymes from memory and composes only in writing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>for he believes that writing has its own features,
and he wants to <i>see the words</i>. Th&eacute;ophile Gautier,
who knows and understands him so well, says: 'I
also believe that in the sentence we need most of all
an <i>ocular</i> rhythm. A book is made to be read, not
to be spoken aloud.'" It is added that "Victor Hugo
never spoke his verses but wrote them out and
would often illustrate them on the margin, as if he
needed to fixate the image in order to find the appropriate
word."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>After visual representations come those of movement:
the steeple <i>pierces</i> the horizon, the mountain
<i>rends</i> the cloud, the mountain <i>raises himself</i> and
looks about, "the cold caverns open their mouths
<i>drowsily</i>," the wind lashes the rock into tears with
the waterfall, the thorn is an enraged plant, and so
on indefinitely.</p>

<p>A more curious fact is the transposition of sonorous
sensations or images of sound, and like them
without form or figure, into visual and motor
images: "The <i>ruffles</i> of sound that the fifer cuts out;
the flute <i>goes up</i> to alto like a frail capital on a column."
This thoroughly plastic imagination remains
identical with itself while reducing everything
spontaneously, unconsciously, to spatial terms.</p>

<p>In literature this altogether foreign mode of creative
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>activity has found its most complete expression
among the <i>Parnassiens</i> and their congeners, whose
creed is summed up in the formula, faultless form
and impassiveness. Th&eacute;ophile Gautier claims that "a
poet, no matter what may be said of him, is a <i>workman</i>;
it is not necessary that he have more intelligence
than a laborer and have knowledge of a state
other than his own, without which he does badly.
I regard as perfectly absurd the mania that people
have of hoisting them (the poets) up onto an ideal
pedestal; <i>nothing is less ideal than a poet</i>. For
him words have in themselves and outside the
meaning they express, their own beauty and value,
just like precious stones not yet cut and mounted in
bracelets, necklaces and rings; they charm the understanding
that looks at them and takes them from
the finger to the little pile where they are put aside
for future use." If this statement, whether sincere
or not, is taken literally, I see no longer any difference,
save as regards the materials employed, between
the imagination of poets and the imagination
active in the mechanical arts. For the usefulness
of the one and the "uselessness" of the other is a
characteristic foreign to invention itself.</p>

<p>3. In the teeming mass of myths and religious
conceptions that the nineteenth century has gathered
with so much care we could establish various classifications&mdash;according
to race, content, intellectual
level; and, in a more artificial manner but one suitable
for our subject, according to the degree of
precision or fluidity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Neglecting intermediate forms, we may, indeed,
divide them into two groups; some are clear in outline,
are consistent, relatively logical, resembling
a definite historical relation; others are vague, multiform,
incoherent, contradictory; their characters
change into one another, the tales are mixed and are
imperceptible in the whole.</p>

<p>The former types are the work of the plastic
imagination. Such are, if we eliminate oriental influences,
most of the myths belonging to Greece
when, on emerging from the earliest period, they
attained their definite constitution. It has been held
that the plastic character of these religious conceptions
is an effect of esthetic development: statues,
bas-reliefs, poetry, and even painting, have made
definite the attributes of the gods and their history.
Without denying this influence we must nevertheless
understand that it is only auxiliary. To those who
would challenge this opinion let us recall that the
Hindoos have had gigantic poems, have covered
their temples with numberless sculptures, and yet
their fluid mythology is the opposite of the Greek.
Among the peoples who have incarnated their divinities
in no statue, in no human or animal form, we
find the Germans and the Celts. But the mythology
of the former is clear, well kept within large lines;
that of the latter is fleeting and inconsistent&mdash;the
despair of scholars.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>It is, then, certain that myths of the plastic kind
are the fruits of an innate quality of mind, of a
mode of feeling and of translating, at a given moment
in its history, the preponderating characters
of a race; in short, of a form of imagination and
ultimately of a special cerebral structure.</p>

<p>4. The most complete manifestation of the plastic
imagination is met with in mechanical invention
and what is allied thereto, in consequence of the need
of very exact representations of qualities and relations.
But this is a specialized form, and, as its importance
has been too often misunderstood, it deserves
a separate study. (See Chapter V, <i>infra</i>.)</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Such are the principal traits of this type of imagination:
clearness of outline, both of the whole and
of the details. It is not identical with the form
called realistic&mdash;it is more comprehensive; it is a
genus of which "realism" is a species. Moreover,
the latter expression being reserved by custom for
esthetic creation, I purposely digress in order to
dwell on this point: that the esthetic imagination
has no essential character belonging exclusively to
it, and that it differs from other forms (scientific,
mechanical, etc.) only in its materials and in its
end, not in its primary nature.</p>

<p>On the whole, the plastic imagination could be
summed up in the expression, <i>clearness in complexity</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
It always preserves the mark of its original
source&mdash;i.e., in the creator and those disposed to
enjoy and understand him it tends to approach the
clearness of perception.</p>

<p>Would it be improper to consider as a variety of
the genus a mode of representation that could be
expressed as <i>clearness in simplicity</i>? It is the dry
and rational imagination. Without depreciating it
we may say that it is rather a condition of imaginative
poverty. We hold with Fouill&eacute;e that the
average Frenchman furnishes a good example of it.
"The Frenchman," says he, "does not usually have
a very strong imagination. His internal vision has
neither the hallucinative intensity nor the exuberant
fancy of the German and Anglo-Saxon mind; it is an
intellectual and distant view rather than a sensitive
resurrection or an immediate contact with, and possession
of, the things themselves. Inclined to deduce
and construct, our intellect excels less in representing
to itself real things than in discovering
relations between possible or necessary things. In
other words, it is a logical and combining imagination
that takes pleasure in what has been termed
the abstract view of life. The Chateaubriands,
Hugos, Flauberts, Zolas, are exceptional with us.
We reason more than we imagine."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Its psychological constitution is reducible to two
elements: slightly concrete images, <i>schemas</i> approaching
general ideas; for their association, relations
predominantly rational, more the products of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span> the logic of the intellect than of the logic of the
feelings. It lacks the sudden, violent shock of emotion
that gives brilliancy to images, making them
arise and grouping them in unforeseen combinations.
It is a form of invention and construction that is
more the work of reason than of imagination
proper.</p>

<p>Consequently, is it not paradoxical to relate it to
plastic imagination, as species to genus? It would
be idle to enter upon a discussion of the subject
here without attempting a classification; let us
merely note the likenesses and differences. Both are
above all objective&mdash;the first, because it is sensory;
the other, because it is rational. Both make use of
analogous modes of association, dependent more on
the nature of things than on the personal impression
of the subject. Opposition exists only on one point:
the former is made up of vivid images that approach
perception; the latter is made up of internal images
bordering upon concepts. Rational imagination is
plastic imagination desiccated and simplified.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE DIFFLUENT IMAGINATION</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The diffluent imagination is another general form,
but one that is completely opposed to the foregoing.
It consists of vaguely-outlined, indistinct images
that are evoked and joined according to the least
rigorous modes of association. It presents, then,
two things for our consideration&mdash;the nature of the
images and of their associations.</p>

<p>(1) It employs neither the clear-cut, concrete,
reality-penetrated images of the plastic imagination,
nor the semi-schematic representations of the rational
imagination, but those midway in that ascending
and descending scale extending from perception
to conception. This determination, however,
is insufficient, and we can make it more precise.
Analysis, indeed, discovers a certain class of
ill-understood images, which I call emotional abstractions,
and which are the proper material for
the diffluent imagination. These images are reduced
to certain qualities or attributes of things,
taking the place of the whole, and chosen from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
among the others for various reasons, the origin of
which is affective. We shall comprehend their nature
better through the following comparison:</p>

<p>Intellectual or rational abstraction results from
the choice of a fundamental, or at least principal,
character, which becomes the substitute for all the
rest that is omitted. Thus, extension, resistance,
or impenetrability, come to represent, through simplification
and abbreviation, what we call "matter."</p>

<p>Emotional abstraction, on the other hand, results
from the permanent or temporary predominance of
an emotional state. Some aspect of a thing, essential
or not, comes into relief, solely because it is in
direct relation to the disposition of our sensibility,
with no other preoccupation; a quality, an attribute
is spontaneously, arbitrarily selected because it impresses
us at the given instant&mdash;in the final analysis,
because it somehow pleases or displeases us. The
images of this class have an "impressionist" mark.
They are abstractions in the strict sense&mdash;i.e., extracts
from and simplifications of the sensory data.
They act less through a direct influence than by
evoking, suggesting, whispering; they permit a
glance, a passing glimpse: we may justly call them
crepuscular or twilight ideas.</p>

<p>(2) As for the forms of association, the relations
linking these images, they do not depend so much
on the order and connections of things as on the
changing dispositions of the mind. They have a
very marked subjective character. Some depend on
the intellectual factor; the most usual are based on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
chance, on distant and vacillating analogies&mdash;further
down, even on assonance and alliteration.
Others depend on the affective factor and are ruled
by the disposition of the moment: association by
contrast, especially those alike in emotional basis,
which have been previously studied. (First Part,
<a href="#Page_31">Chapter II</a>.)</p>

<p>Thus the diffluent imagination is, trait for trait,
the opposite of the plastic imagination. It has a
general character of inwardness because it arises
less from sensation than from feeling, often from a
simple and fugitive impression. Its creations have
not the organic character of the other, lacking a
stable center of attraction; but they act by diffusion
and inclusion.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>By its very nature it is <i>de jure</i>, if not <i>de facto</i>,
excluded from certain territories&mdash;if it ventures
therein it produces only abortions. This is true of
the practical sphere, which permits neither vague
images nor approximate constructions; and of the
scientific world, where the imagination may be used
only to create a theory or invent processes of discovery
(experiments, schemes of reasoning). Even
with these exceptions there is still left for it a very
wide range.</p>

<p>Let us rapidly pass over some very frequent, very
well-known manifestations of the diffluent imagination&mdash;those
obliterated forms in which it does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
reach complete development and cannot give the
full measure of its power.</p>

<p>(1) Revery and related states. This is perhaps
the purest specimen of the kind, but it remains
embryonic.</p>

<p>(2) The romantic turn of mind. This is seen in
those who, confronted by any event whatever or an
unknown person, make up, spontaneously, involuntarily,
in spite of themselves, a story out of whole
cloth. I shall later give examples of it according
to the written testimony of several people.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In
whatever concerns themselves or others they create
an imagined world, which they substitute for the
real.</p>

<p>(3) The fantastic mind. Here we come away
from the vague forms; the diffluent imagination becomes
substantial and asserts itself through its permanence.
At bottom this fantastic form is the romantic
spirit tending toward objectification. The
invention, which was at first only a thoroughly internal
construction and recognized as such, aspires
to become external, to become realized, and when
it ventures into a world other than its own, one requiring
the rigorous conditions of the practical
imagination, it is wrecked, or succeeds only through
chance, and that very rarely. To this class belong
those inventors, known to everyone, who are fertile
in methods of enriching themselves or their country
by means of agricultural, mining, industrial or commercial
enterprises; the makers of the utopias of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
finance, politics, society, etc. It is a form of imagination
unnaturally oriented toward the practical.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>(4) The list increases with myths and religious
conceptions; the imagination in its diffuse form here
finds itself on its own ground.</p>

<p>Depending on linguistics, it has recently been
maintained that, among the Aryans at least, the
imagination created at first only momentary gods
(<i>Augenblicksg&ouml;tter</i>).<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Every time that primitive
man, in the presence of a phenomenon, experienced
a perceptible emotion, he translated it by a name,
the manifestation of what was imagined the divine
part in the emotion felt. "Every religious emotion
gives rise to a new name&mdash;i.e., a new divinity. But
the religious imagination is never identical with itself;
though produced by the same phenomenon, it
translates itself, at two different moments, by two
different words." As a consequence, "during the
early periods of the human race, religious names
must have been applied not to <i>classes</i> of beings or
events but to <i>individual</i> beings or events. Before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
worshipping the comet or the fig-tree, men must
have worshiped each one of the comets they beheld
crossing the sky, every one of the fig-trees that their
eyes saw." Later, with advancing capacity for generalization,
these "instantaneous" divinities would
be condensed into more consistent gods. If this
hypothesis, which has aroused many criticisms,
be sound&mdash;if this state were met with&mdash;it would be
the ideal type of imaginative instability in the religious
order.</p>

<p>Nearer to us, authentic evidence shows that certain
peoples, at given stages of their history, have
created such vague, fluid myths, that we cannot
succeed in delimiting them. Every god can change
himself into another, different, or even opposite,
one. The Semitic religions might furnish examples
of this. There has been established the identity of
Istar, Astarte, Tanit, Baalath, Derketo, Mylitta,
Aschera, and still others. But it is in the early
religion of the Hindoos that we perceive best this
kaleidoscopic process applied to divine beings. In
the vedic hymns not only are the clouds now serpents,
now cows and later fortresses (the retreats of
dark Asuras), but we see Agni (fire) becoming
Kama (desire or love), and Indra becoming
Varuna, and so on. "We cannot imagine," says
Taine, "such a great clearness. The myth here is
not a disguise, but an expression; no language is
more true and more supple. It permits a glimpse
of, or rather, it causes us to discern the forms of
clouds, movements of the air, changes of seasons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
all the happenings of sky, fire, storm: external
nature has never met a mind so impressionable and
pliant in which to mirror itself in all the inexhaustible
variety of its appearances. However changeable
nature may be, this imagination corresponds to
it. It has no fixed gods; they are changeable like
the things themselves; they blend one into another.
Everyone of them is in turn the supreme deity; no
one of them is a distinct personality; everyone is
only a moment of nature, able, according to the
apperception of the moment, to include its neighbor
or be included by it. In this fashion they swarm
and teem. Every moment of nature and every
apperceptive moment may furnish one of them."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Let us, indeed, note that, for the worshiper, the
god to whom he addresses himself and while he is
praying, is always the greatest and most powerful.
The assignment of attributes passes suddenly from
one to the other, regardless of contradiction. In
this versatility some writers believe they have discovered
a vague pantheistic conception. Nothing is
more questionable, fundamentally, than this interpretation.
It is more in harmony with the psychology
of these na&iuml;ve minds to assume simply an
extreme state of "impressionism," explicable by the
logic of feeling.</p>

<p>Thus, there is a complete antithesis between the
imagination that has created the clear-cut and
definite polytheism of the Greeks and that whence
have issued those fluctuating divinities that allow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the presentation of the future doctrine of <i>M&acirc;ya</i>, of
universal illusion&mdash;another more refined form of
the diffluent imagination. Finally, let us note that
the Hellenic imagination realized its gods through
anthropomorphism&mdash;they are the ideal forms of
human attributes<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>&mdash;majesty, beauty, power, wisdom,
etc. The Hindoo imagination proceeds
through symbolism: its divinities have several
heads, several arms, several legs, to symbolize
limitless intelligence, power, etc.; or better still,
animal forms, as e.g., Ganesa, the god of wisdom,
with the head of the elephant, reputed the wisest
of animals.</p>

<p>(5) It would be easy to show by the history of
literature and the fine arts that the vague forms
have been preferred according to peoples, times, and
places. Let us limit ourselves to a single contemporary
example that is complete and systematically
created&mdash;the art of the "symbolists." It is not here
a question of criticism, of praise, or even of appreciation,
but merely of a consideration of it as a
psychological fact likely to instruct us in regard to
the nature of the diffluent imagination.</p>

<p>This form of art despises the clear and exact
representation of the outer world: it replaces it by
a sort of music that aspires to express the changing
and fleeting inwardness of the human soul. It is
the school of the subject "who wants to know only
mental states." To that end, it makes use of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
natural or artificial lack of precision: everything
floats in a dream, men as well as things, often without
mark in time and space. Something happens,
one knows not where or when; it belongs to no
country, is of no period in time: it is <i>the</i> forest,
<i>the</i> traveler, <i>the</i> city, <i>the</i> knight, <i>the</i> wood; less
frequently, even <i>He</i>, <i>She</i>, <i>It</i>. In short, all the
vague and unstable characters of the pure, content-less
affective state. This process of "suggestion"
sometimes succeeds, sometimes fails.</p>

<p>The word is the sign <i>par excellence</i>. As, according
to the symbolists, it should give us emotions
rather than representations, it is necessary that it
lose, partially, its intellectual function and undergo
a new adaptation.</p>

<p>A principal process consists of employing usual
words and changing their ordinary acceptation, or
rather, associating them in such a way that they
lose their precise meaning, and appear vague and
mysterious: these are the words "written in the
depths." The writers do not name&mdash;they leave it
for us to infer. "They banish commonplaces
through lack of precision, and leave to things only
the power of moving." A rose is not described by
the particular sensations that it causes, but by the
general condition that it excites.</p>

<p>Another method is the employment of new words
or words that have fallen into disuse. Ordinary
words retain, in spite of everything, somewhat of
their customary meaning, associations and thoughts
condensed in them through long habit; words forgotten
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>during four or five centuries escape this condition&mdash;they
are coins without fixed value.</p>

<p>Lastly, a still more radical method is the attempt
to give to words an exclusively emotional valuation.
Unconsciously or as the result of reflection some
symbolists have come to this extreme trial, which
the logic of events imposed upon them. Ordinarily,
thought expresses itself in words; feeling, in gestures,
cries, interjections, change of tone: it finds
its complete and classic expression in music. The
symbolists want to transfer the r&ocirc;le of sound to
words, to make of them the instrument for translating
and suggesting emotion through sound alone:
words have to act not as signs but as sounds: they
are "musical notes in the service of an impassioned
psychology."</p>

<p>All this, indeed, concerns only imagination expressing
itself in words; but we know that the
symbolic school has applied itself to the plastic arts,
to treat them in its own way. The difference, however,
is in the vesture that the esthetic ideal assumes.
The pre-Raphaelites have attempted, by effacing
forms, outlines, semblances, colors, "to cause things
to appear as mere sources of emotion," in a word, to
<i>paint</i> emotions.</p>

<p>To sum up&mdash;In this form of the diffluent imagination
the emotional factor exercises supreme
authority.</p>

<p>May the type of imagination, the chief manifestations
of which we have just enumerated, be considered
as identical with the idealistic imagination?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
This question is similar to that asked in the preceding
chapter, and permits the same answer. In
idealistic art, doubtless, the material element furnished
in perception (form, color, touch, effort) is
minimized, subtilized, sublimated, refined, so as to
approach as nearly as possible to a purely internal
state. By the nature of its favorite images, by its
preference for vague associations and uncertain
relations, it presents all the characteristics of diffluent
imagination; but the latter covers a much
broader field: it is the genus of which the other is
a species. Thus, it would be erroneous to regard
the fantastic imagination as idealistic; it has no
claim to the term: on the contrary, it believes itself
adapted for practical work and acts in that direction.</p>

<p>In addition, it must be recognized that were we
to make a complete review of all the forms of
esthetic creation, we should frequently be embarrassed
to classify them, because there are among
them, as in the case of characters, mixed or composite
forms. Here, for example, are two kinds
seemingly belonging to the diffluent imagination
which, however, do not permit it to completely
include them.</p>

<p>(a) The "wonder" class (fairy-tales, the Thousand
and One Nights, romances of chivalry,
Ariosto's poem, etc.) is a survival of the mythic
epoch, when the imagination is given free play
without control or check; whereas, in the course of
centuries, art&mdash;and especially literary creation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>&mdash;becomes,
as we have already said, a decadent and
rationalized mythology. This form of invention
consists neither of idealizing the external world,
nor reproducing it with the minuteness of realism,
but <i>remaking</i> the universe to suit oneself, without
taking into account natural laws, and despising the
impossible: it is a liberated realism. Often, in an
environment of pure fancy, where only caprice
reigns, the characters appear clear, well-fashioned,
living. The "wonder" class belongs, then, to the
vague as well as to the plastic imagination; more
or less to one or to the other, according to the
temperament of the creator.</p>

<p>(b) The fantastic class develops under the same
conditions. Its chiefs (Hoffmann, Poe, <i>et al.</i>) are
classed by critics as realists. They are such by
virtue of their vision, intensified to hallucination,
the precision in details, the rigorous logic of characters
and events: they rationalize the improbable.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
On the other hand, the environment is strange,
shrouded in mystery: men and things move in an
unreal atmosphere, where one feels rather than perceives.
It is thus proper to remark that this class
easily glides into the deeply sad, the horrible, terrifying,
nightmare-producing, "satanic literature;"
Goya's paintings of robbers and thieves being garroted;
Wiertz, a genius bizarre to the point of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
extravagance, who paints only suicides or the heads
of guillotined criminals.</p>

<p>Religious conceptions could also furnish a fine lot
of examples: Dante's <i>Inferno</i>, the twenty-eight
hells of Buddhism, which are perhaps the masterpieces
of this class, etc. But all this belongs to
another division of our subject, one that I have
expressly eliminated from this essay&mdash;the pathology
of the creative imagination.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>There yet remains for us to study two important
varieties that I connect with the diffluent imagination.</p>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">Numerical Imagination</span></p>

<p>Under this head I designate the imagination that
takes pleasure in the unlimited&mdash;in infinity of time
and space&mdash;under the form of number. It seems
at first that these two terms&mdash;imagination and
number&mdash;must be mutually exclusive. Every number
is precise, rigorously determined, since we can
always reduce it to a relation with unity; it owes
nothing to fancy. But the <i>series</i> of numbers is
unlimited in two directions: starting from any term
in the series, we may go on ever increasingly or
ever decreasingly. The working of the mind gives
rise to a possible infinity that is limitless: it thus
traces a route for the movement of the imagination.
The number, or rather the series of numbers, is less
an object than a vehicle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>This form of imagination is produced in two
principal ways&mdash;in religious conceptions and cosmogonies,
and in science.</p>

<p>(1) Numerical imagination has nowhere been
more exuberant than among the peoples of the
Orient. They have played with number with magnificent
audacity and prodigality. Chaldean cosmogony
relates that <i>Oannes</i>, the Fish-god, devoted
259,200 years to the education of mankind, then
came a period of 432,000 years taken up with the
reigns of mythical personages, and at the end of
these 691,000 years, the deluge renewed the face
of the earth. The Egyptians, also, were liberal with
millions of years, and in the face of the brief and
limited chronology of the Greeks (another kind of
imagination) were wont to exclaim, "You, O
Greeks, you are only children!" But the Hindoos
have done better than all that. They have invented
enormous units to serve as basis and content for
their numerical fancies: the <i>Koti</i>, equivalent to ten
millions; the <i>Kalpa</i> (or the age of the world between
two destructions), 4,328,000,000 years.
Each <i>Kalpa</i> is merely one of 365 days of divine
life: I leave to the reader, if he is so inclined, the
work of calculating this appalling number. The
Djanas divide time into two periods, one ascending,
the other descending: each is of fabulous duration,
2,000,000,000,000,000 oceans of years; each ocean
being itself equivalent to 1,000,000,000,000,000
years. "If there were a lofty rock, sixteen miles in
each dimension, and one touched it once in a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>years with a bit of the finest Benares linen, it
would be reduced to the size of a wango-stone
before a fourth of one of these <i>Kalpas</i> had rolled
by." In the sacred books of Buddhism, poor, dry,
colorless, as they ordinarily are, imagination in its
numerical forms is triumphant. The <i>Lalitavistara</i>
is full of nomenclatures and enumerations of fatiguing
monotony: Buddha is seated on a rock shaded
by 100,000 parasols, surrounded by minor gods
forming an assemblage of 68,000 <i>Kotis</i> (i.e., 680,000,000
persons), and&mdash;this surpasses all the rest&mdash;"he
had experienced many vicissitudes during
10,100,000,000 <i>Kalpas</i>." This makes one dizzy.</p>

<p>(2) Numerical imagination in the sciences does
not take on these delirious forms; it has the advantage
of resting on an objective basis: it is the
substitute of an unrepresentable reality. Scientific
culture, which people often accuse of stifling imagination,
on the contrary opens to it a field much
vaster than esthetics. Astronomy delights in infinitudes
of time and space: it sees worlds arise, burn
at first with the feeble light of a nebular mass, glow
like suns, become chilled, covered with spots, and
then become condensed. Geology follows the development
of our earth through upheavals and cataclysms:
it foresees a distant future when our globe,
deprived of the atmospheric vapors that protect it,
will perish of cold. The hypotheses of physics and
chemistry in regard to atoms and molecules are not
less reckless than the speculations of the Hindoo
imagination. "Physicists have determined the volume
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>of a molecule, and referring to the numbers
that they give, we find that a cube, a millimeter
each way (scarcely the volume of a silkworm's
egg), would contain a number of molecules at least
equal to the cube of 10,000,000&mdash;i.e., unity followed
by twenty-one zeros. One scientist has calculated
that if one had to count them and could
separate in thought a million per second, it would
take more than 250,000,000 years: the being who
commenced the task at the time that our solar
system could have been no more than a formless
nebula, would not yet have reached the end."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
Biology, with its protoplasmic elements, its plastids,
gemmules, hypotheses on hereditary transmission
by means of infinitesimal subdivisions; the theory
of evolution, which speaks off-hand of periods of a
hundred thousand years; and many other scientific
theses that I omit, offer fine material for the numerical
imagination.</p>

<p>More than one scientist has even made use of this
form of imagination for the pleasure of developing
a purely fanciful notion. Thus Von Baer, supposing
that we might perceive the portions of duration
in another way, imagines the changes that would
result therefrom in our outlook on nature: "Suppose
we were able, within the length of a second, to
note 10,000 events distinctly, instead of barely 10,
as now; if our life were then destined to hold the
same number of impressions, it might be 1,000 times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
as short. We should live less than a month, and
personally know nothing of the change of seasons.
If born in winter, we should believe in summer as
we now believe in the heats of the Carboniferous
era. The motions of organic beings would be so
slow to our senses as to be inferred, not seen. The
sun would stand still in the sky, the moon be almost
free from change, and so on. But now reverse the
hypothesis and suppose a being to get only one
1,000th part of the sensations that we get in a given
time, and consequently to live 1,000 times as long.
Winters and summers will be to him like quarters
of an hour. Mushrooms and the swifter-growing
plants will shoot into being so rapidly as to appear
instantaneous creations; annual shrubs will rise and
fall from the earth like restlessly boiling water
springs; the motions of animals will be as invisible
as are to us the movements of bullets and cannonballs;
the sun will scour through the sky like a
meteor, leaving a fiery trail behind him, etc."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The psychologic conditions of this variety of the
creative imagination are, then, these: Absence of
limitation in time and space, whence the possibility
of an endless movement in all directions, and the
possibility of filling either with a myriad of dimly-perceived
events. These events not being susceptible
of clear representation as to their nature and
quantity, escaping even a schematic representation,
the imagination makes its constructions with substitutes
that are, in this case, numbers.</p>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">Musical Imagination</span></p>

<p>Musical imagination deserves a separate monograph.
As the task requires, in addition to psychological
capacity, a profound knowledge of musical
history and technique, it cannot be undertaken here.
I purpose only one thing, namely, to show that it
has its own individual mark&mdash;that it is the type of
affective imagination.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> attempted to prove that, contrary
to the general opinion of psychologists, there
exists, in many men at least, an affective memory;
that is, a memory of emotions strictly so called, and
not merely of the intellectual conditions that caused
and accompanied them. I hold that there exists
also a form of the creative imagination that is
purely emotional&mdash;the contents of which are wholly
made up of states of mind, dispositions, wants, aspirations,
feelings, and emotions of all kinds, and that
it is the characteristic of the composer of genius, of
the born musician.</p>

<p>The musician sees in the world what concerns
him. "He carries in his head a coherent system of
tone-images, in which every element has its place
and value; he perceives delicate differences of sound,
of <i>timbre</i>; he succeeds, through exercise, in penetrating
into their most varied combinations, and the
knowledge of harmonious relations is for him what
design and the knowledge of color are for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
painter: intervals and harmony, rhythm and tone-qualities
are, as it were, standards to which he
relates his present perceptions and which he causes
to enter into the marvelous constructions of his
fancy."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>These sound-elements and their combinations are
the words of a special language that is very clear
for some, impenetrable for others. People have
spoken to a tiresome extent of the vagueness of
musical expression; some have been pleased to hold
that every one may interpret it in his own way. We
must surely recognize that emotional language does
not possess the precision of intellectual language;
but in music it is the same as in any other idiom:
there are those who do not understand at all; those
who half understand and consequently always give
wrong renderings; and those who understand well&mdash;and
in this last category there are grades as varying
as the aptitude for perceiving the delicate and subtle
shades of speech.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p>The materials necessary for this form of imaginative
construction are gathered slowly. Many
centuries passed between the early ages when man's
voice and the simple instruments imitating it translated
simple emotions, to the period when the efforts
of antiquity and of the middle ages finally furnished
the musical imagination with the means of expressing
itself completely, and allowed complex and difficult
constructions in sound. The development of
music&mdash;slow and belated as compared to the other
arts&mdash;has perhaps been due, in part at least, to the
fact that the affective imagination, its chief province
(imitative, descriptive, picturesque music being only
an episode and accessory), being made up, contrary
to sensorial imagination, of tenuous, subtle, fugitive
states, has been long in seeking its methods of
analysis and of expression. However it be, Bach
and the contrapuntists, by their treatment in an
independent manner of the different voices constituting
harmony, have opened a new path. Henceforth
melody will be able to develop and give rise
to the richest combinations. We shall be able to
associate various melodies, sing them at the same
time, or in alternation, assign them to various instruments,
vary indefinitely the pitch of singing and
concerted voices. The boundless realm of musical
combinations is open; it has been worth while to
take the trouble to invent. Modern polyphony with
its power of expressing at the same time different,
even opposing, feelings is a marvelous instrument<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
for a form of imagination which, alien to the forms
clear-cut in space, moves only in time.</p>

<p>What furnishes us the best entrance into the
psychology of this form of imagination is the natural
transposition operative in musicians. It consists
in this: An external or internal impression,
any occurrence whatever, even a metaphysical idea,
undergoes change of a certain kind, which the following
examples will make better understood than
any amount of commentary.</p>

<p>Beethoven said of Klopstock's <i>Messiah</i>, "always
<i>maestoso</i>, written in <i>D flat major</i>." In his fourth
symphony he expressed musically the destiny of
Napoleon; in the ninth symphony he tries to give
a proof of the existence of God. By the side of a
dead friend, in a room draped in black, he improvises
the <i>adagio</i> of the sonata in <i>C sharp minor</i>.
The biographers of Mendelssohn relate analogous
instances of transposition under musical form.
During a storm that almost engulfed George Sand,
Chopin, alone in the house, under the influence of
his agony, and half unconsciously, composed one of
his <i>Pr&eacute;ludes</i>. The case of Schumann is perhaps
the most curious of all: "From the age of eight,
he would amuse himself with sketching what might
be called musical portraits, drawing by means of
various turns of song and varied rhythms the shades
of character, and even the physical peculiarities, of
his young comrades. He sometimes succeeded in
making such striking resemblances that all would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
recognize, with no further designation, the figure
indicated by the skillful fingers that genius was
already guiding." He said later: "I feel myself
affected by all that goes on in the world&mdash;men,
politics, literature; I reflect on all that in my own
way and it issues outwards in the form of music.
That is why many of my compositions are so hard
to understand: they relate to events of distant
interest, though important; but everything remarkable
that is furnished me by the period I must
express musically." Let us recall again that Weber
interpreted in one of the finest scenes of his <i>Freysch&uuml;tz</i>
(the bullet-casting scene) "a landscape that
he had seen near the falls of Geroldsau, at the hour
when the moon's rays cause the basin in which the
water rushes and boils to glisten like silver."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> In
short, the events go into the composer's brain, mix
there, and come out changed into a musical structure.</p>

<p>The plastic imagination furnishes us a counter-proof:
it transposes inversely. The musical impression
traverses the brain, sets it in turmoil, but
comes out transformed into visual images. We
have already cited examples from Victor Hugo (<a href="#Page_184">ch.
I</a>); Goethe, we know, had poor musical gifts. After
having the young Mendelssohn render an overture
from Bach, he exclaimed, "How pompous and grand
that is! It seems to me like a procession of grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
personages, in gala attire, descending the steps of
a gigantic staircase."</p>

<p>We might generalize the question and ask
whether or no there exists a natural antagonism
between true musical imagination and plastic imagination.
An answer in the affirmative seems scarcely
liable to be challenged. I had undertaken an investigation
which, at the outset, made for a different
goal. It happens that it answered clearly enough
the question propounded above: the conclusion has
arisen of itself, unsought; which fact saves me from
any charge of a preconceived opinion.</p>

<p>The question asked orally of a large number of
people was this: "Does hearing or even remembering
a bit of <i>symphonic</i> music excite visual images
in you and of what kind are they?" For self evident
reasons dramatic music was expressly excluded:
the appearance of the theater, stage, and
scenery impose on the observer visual perceptions
that have a tendency to be repeated later in the
form of memories.</p>

<p>The result of observation and of the collected
answers are summed up as follows:</p>

<p>Those who possess great musical culture and&mdash;this
is by far more important&mdash;taste or passion for
music, generally have no visual images. If these
arise, it is only momentarily, and by chance. I give
a few of the answers: "I see absolutely nothing; I
am occupied altogether with the pleasure of the
music: I live entirely in a world of sound. In
accordance with my knowledge of harmony, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
analyze the harmonies but not for long. I follow
the development of the phrasing." "I see nothing:
I am given up wholly to my impressions. I believe
that the chief effect of music is to heighten in everyone
the predominating feelings."</p>

<p>Those who possess little musical culture, and
especially those having little taste for music, have
very clear visual representations. It must nevertheless
be admitted that it is very hard to investigate
these people. Because of their anti-musical natures,
they avoid concerts, or at the most, resign themselves
to sit through an opera. However, since the
nature and quality of the music does not matter
here, we may quote: "Hearing a Barbary organ in
the street, I picture the instrument to myself. I see
the man turning the crank. If military music sounds
from afar, I <i>see</i> a regiment marching." An excellent
pianist plays for a friend Beethoven's sonata in
C sharp minor, putting into its execution all the
pathos of which he is capable. The other sees in it
"the tumult and excitement of a fair." Here the
musical rendering is misinterpreted through misapprehension.
I have several times noted this&mdash;in
people familiar with design or painting, music calls
up pictures and various scenes; one of these persons
says that he is "besieged by visual images." Here
the hearing of music evidently acts as excitant.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<p>In a word, insofar as it is permissible in psychology
to make use of general formulas&mdash;and with the
proviso that they apply to most, not to all cases&mdash;we
may say that during the working of the musical
imagination the appearance of visual images is the
exception; that when this form of imagination is
weak, the appearance of images is the rule.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this result of observation is altogether
in accord with logic. There is an irreducible
antithesis between affective imagination, the characteristic
of which is interiority, and visual imagination,
basically objective. Intellectual language<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>&mdash;speech&mdash;is
an arrangement of words that stand for
objects, qualities, relations, extracts of things: in
order to be understood they must call up in consciousness
the corresponding images. Emotional
language&mdash;music&mdash;is an appropriate ordering of
successive or simultaneous sounds, of melodies and
harmonies that are signs of affective states: in order
to be understood, they must call up in consciousness
the corresponding affective modifications. But, in
the non-musically inclined, the evocative power is
small&mdash;sonorous combinations excite only superficial
and unstable internal states. The exterior excitation,
that of the sounds, follows the line of least
resistance, and acting according to the psychic nature
of the individual, tends to arouse objective
images, pictures, visual representations, well or ill
adapted.</p>

<p>To sum up: In contrast to sensorial imagination,
which has its origin without, affective imagination
begins within. The <i>stuff</i> of its creation is found in
the mental states enumerated above, and in their
innumerable combinations, which it expresses and
fixes in language peculiar to itself, of which it has
been able to make wonderful use. Taking it altogether,
the only great division possible between the
different types of imagination is perhaps reducible
to this: To speak more exactly, there are exterior
and interior imaginations. These two chapters have
given a sketch of them. There now remains for us
to study the less general forms of the creative
power.</p>

Under the title "An experimental test of musical expressiveness,"
Gilman, in <i>American Journal of Psychology</i>, vol. IV,

point of view the effect of music on various listeners. Eleven
selections were given; I note that three or four at the most
excited visual images&mdash;ten (perhaps eleven), emotional states.
More recently, the <i>Psychological Review</i> (September, 1898, pp.
463 ff.) has published a personal observation of Macdougal in
which sight-images accompany the hearing of music only exceptionally
and under special conditions. The author characterizes
himself as a "poor visualizer;" he declares that music arouses
in him only very rarely visual representations; "even then
they are fragmentary, consisting of simple forms without bond
between them, appearing on a dark background, remaining
visible for a moment or two, and soon disappearing." But,
having gone to the concert fatigued and jaded, he sees nothing
during the first number: the visions begin during the <i>andante</i>
of the second, and accompany "in profusion" the rendering
of the third. (See Appendix D.) May we not assume that the
state of fatigue, by lowering the vital tone, which is the basis
of the emotional life, likewise diminishes the tendency of affective
dispositions to arise again under the form of memory?
On the other hand, sensory images remain without opposition
and come to the front; at least, unless they are re&euml;nforced by
a state of semi-morbid excitation.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTIC IMAGINATION</h3>


<p>Mystic imagination deserves a place of honor, as
it is the most complete and most daring of purely
theoretic invention. Related to diffluent imagination,
especially in the latter's affective form, it has
its own special characters, which we shall try to
separate out.</p>

<p>Mysticism rests essentially on two modes of
mental life&mdash;feeling, which we need not study; and
imagination, which, in the present instance, represents
the intellectual factor. Whether the part of
consciousness that this state of mind requires and
permits be imaginative in nature and nothing else
it is easy to find out. Indeed, the mystic considers
the data of sense as vain appearances, or at the most
as signs revealing and frequently laying bare the
world of reality. He therefore finds no solid support
in perception. On the other hand, he scorns
reasoned thought, looking upon it as a cripple, halting
half-way. He makes neither deductions nor
inductions, and does not draw conclusions after the
method of scientific hypotheses. The conclusion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
then, is that he imagines, i.e., that he realizes a
construction in images that is for him knowledge
of the world; and he never proceeds, and does not
proceed here, save <i>ex analogia hominis</i>.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The root of the mystic imagination consists of a
tendency to incarnate the ideal in the sensible, to
discover a hidden "idea" in every material phenomenon
or occurrence, to suppose in things a supranatural
principle that reveals itself to whoever may
penetrate to it. Its fundamental character, from
which the others are derived, is thus a way of thinking
<i>symbolically</i>; but the algebraist also thinks by
means of symbols, yet is not on that account a
mystic. The nature of this symbolism must, then,
be determined.</p>

<p>In doing so, let us note first of all that our images&mdash;understanding
the word "image" in its broadest
sense&mdash;may be divided into two distinct groups:</p>

<p>(1) <i>Concrete</i> images, earliest to be received, being
representations of greatest power, residues of our
perceptions, with which they have a direct and immediate
relation.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Symbolic</i> images, or signs, of secondary acquirement,
being representations of lesser power,
having only indirect and mediate relations with
things.</p>

<p>Let us make the differences between the two clear
by a few simple examples.</p>

<p>Concrete images are: In the visual sphere, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
recollection of faces, monuments, landscapes, etc.;
in the auditory sphere, the remembrance of the
sounds of the sea, wind, the human voice, a melody,
etc.; in the motor sphere, the tossings one feels when
resting after having been at sea, the illusions of
those who have had limbs amputated, etc.</p>

<p>Symbolic images are: In the visual order, written
words, ideographic signs, etc.; in the auditory
order, spoken words or verbal images; in the motor
order, significant gestures, and even better, the
finger-language of deaf-mutes.</p>

<p>Psychologically, these two groups are not identical
in nature. Concrete images result from a persistence
of perceptions and draw from the latter all
their validity; symbolic images result from a mental
synthesis, from an association of perception and
image, or of image and image. If they have not
the same origin, no more do they disappear in the
same way, as is proven by very numerous examples
of aphasia.</p>

<p>The originality of mystic imagination is found in
this fact: It transforms concrete images into symbolic
images, and uses them as such. It extends
this process even to perceptions, so that all manifestations
of nature or of human art take on a value
as signs or symbols. We shall later find numerous
examples of this. Its mode of expression is necessarily
synthetic. In itself, and because of the materials
that it makes use of, it differs from the affective
imagination previously described; it also differs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
from sensuous imagination, which makes use of
forms, movements, colors, as having a value of their
own; and from the imagination developing in the
functions of words, through an analytic process. It
has thus a rather special mark.</p>

<p>Other characters are related to this one of symbolism,
or else are derived from it, viz.:</p>

<p>(1) An external character: the manner of writing
and of speaking, the mode of expression, whatever
it is. "The dominant style among mystics," says
von Hartmann, "is metaphorical in the extreme&mdash;now
flat and ordinary, more often turgid and emphatic.
Excess of imagination betrays itself there,
ordinarily, in the thought and in the form in which
that is rendered.... A sign of mysticism
which it has been believed may often be taken as an
essential sign, is obscurity and unintelligibility of
language. We find it in almost all those who have
written."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> We might add that even in the plastic
arts, symbolists and "<i>d&eacute;cadents</i>" have attempted, as
far as possible, methods that merely indicate and
suggest or hint instead of giving real, definite objects:
which fact makes them inaccessible to the
greater number of people.</p>

<p>This characteristic of obscurity is due to two
causes. First, mystical imagination is guided by
the logic of feeling, which is purely subjective, full
of leaps, jerks, and gaps. Again, it makes use of
the language of images, especially visual images&mdash;a
language whose ideal is vagueness, just as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
ideal of verbal language is precision. All this can
be summed up in a phrase&mdash;the subjective character
inherent in the symbol. While seeming to speak
like everyone else, the mystic uses a personal idiom:
things becoming symbols at the pleasure of his
fancy, he does not use signs that have a fixed and
universally admitted value. It is not surprising if
we do not understand him.</p>

<p>(2) An extraordinary abuse of analogy and comparison
in their various forms (allegory, parable,
etc.)&mdash;a natural consequence of a mode of thinking
that proceeds by means of symbols, not concepts.
It has been said, and rightly, that "the only force
that makes the vast field of mysticism fruitful is
analogy."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Bossuet, a great opponent of mystics,
had already remarked: "One of the characteristics
of these authors is the pushing of allegories to the
extreme limit." With warm imagination, having at
their disposal overexcited senses, they are lavish of
changes of expressions and figures, hoping thereby
to explain the world's mysteries. We know to what
inventive labors the Vedas, the Bible, the Koran,
and other sacred books have given rise. The distinction
between literal and figurative sense, which
is boundlessly arbitrary, has given commentators a
freedom to imagine equal to that of the myth-creators.</p>

<p>All this is yet very reasonable; but the imagination
left to itself stops at no extravagance. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
having strained the meaning of expressions, the
imaginative mind exercises itself on words and
letters. Thus, the cabalists would take the first or
the last letters of the words composing a verse, and
would form with them a new word which was to
reveal the hidden meaning. Again, they would
substitute for the letters composing words the numbers
that these letters represent in the Hebrew
numerical system and form the strangest combinations
with them. In the <i>Zohar</i>, all the letters of the
alphabet come before God, each one begging to be
chosen as the creative element of the universe.</p>

<p>Let us also bring to mind numerical mysticism,
different from numerical imagination heretofore
studied. Here, number is no longer the means that
mind employs in order to soar in time and space; it
becomes a symbol and material for fanciful construction.
Hence arise those "sacred numbers"
teeming in the old oriental religions:&mdash;3, symbol of
the trinity; 4, symbol of the cosmic elements; 7,
representing the moon and the planets, etc.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Besides
these fantastic meanings, there are more complicated
inventions&mdash;calculating, from the letters of
one's name, the years of life of a sick person, the
auspices of a marriage, etc. The Pythagorean
philosophy, as Zeller has shown, is the systematic
form of this mathematical mysticism, for which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
numbers are not symbols of quantitative relations,
but the very essence of things.</p>

<p>This exaggerated symbolism, which makes the
works of mystics so fragile, and which permits the
mind to feed only on glimpses, has nevertheless an
undeniable source of energy in its enchanting capacity
to suggest. Without doubt suggestion exists
also in art, but much more weakly, for reasons that
we shall indicate.</p>

<p>(3) Another characteristic of mystic imagination
is the nature and the great degree of belief accompanying
it. We already know<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> that when an image
enters consciousness, even in the form of a recollection,
of a purely passive reproduction, it appears
at first, and for a moment, just as real as a percept.
Much more so, in the case of imaginative constructions.
But this illusion has degrees, and with
mystics it attains its maximum.</p>

<p>In the scientific and practical world, the work of
the imagination is accompanied by only a conditional
and provisional belief. The construction in
images must justify its existence, in the case of the
scientist, by explaining; and in the case of the man
of affairs, by being embodied in an invention that is
useful and answers its purpose.</p>

<p>In the esthetic field, creation is accompanied by
a momentary belief. Fancy, remarks Groos, is
necessarily joined to appearance. Its special character
does not consist merely in freedom in images;
what distinguishes it from association and from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
memory is this&mdash;that what is merely representative
is taken for the reality. The creative artist has a
conscious illusion (<i>bewusste Selbstt&auml;uschung</i>): <i>the
esthetic pleasure is an oscillation between the appearance
and the reality</i>.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Mystic imagination presupposes an unconditioned
and permanent belief. Mystics are believers in the
true sense&mdash;they have faith. This character is
peculiar to them, and has its origin in the intensity
of the affective state that excites and supports this
form of invention. Intuition becomes an object of
knowledge only when clothed in images. There has
been much dispute as to the objective value of those
symbolic forms that are the working material of the
mystic imagination. This contest does not concern
us here; but we may make the positive statement
that the constructive imagination has never obtained
such a frequently hallucinatory form as in the
mystics. Visions, touch-illusions, external voices,
inner and "wordless" voices, which we now regard
as psycho-motor hallucinations&mdash;all that we meet
every moment in their works, until they become
commonplace. But as to the nature of these psychic
states there are only two solutions possible&mdash;one,
naturalistic, that we shall indicate; the other, supernatural,
which most theologians hold, and which
regards these phenomena as valid and true revelation.
In either case, the mystic imagination seems
to us naturally tending toward objectification. It
tends outwardly, by a spontaneous movement that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
places it on the same level as reality. Whichever
conclusion we adopt, no imaginative type has the
same great gift of energy and permanence in belief.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Mystic imagination, working along the lines peculiar
to it, produces cosmological, religious, and
metaphysical constructions, a summary exposition
of which will help us understand its true nature.</p>

<p>(1) The all-embracing cosmological form is the
conception of the world by a purely imaginative
being. It is rare, abnormal, and is nowadays met
with only in a few artists, dreamers, or morbidly
esthetic persons, as a kind of survival and temporary
form. Thus, Victor Hugo sees in each letter
of the alphabet the pictured imitation of one of the
objects essential to human knowledge: "<i>A</i> is the
head, the gable, the cross-beam, the arch, <i>arx</i>; <i>D</i>
is the back, <i>dos</i>; <i>E</i> is the basement, the console, etc.,
so that man's house and its architecture, man's body
and its structure, and then justice, music, the
church, war, harvesting, geometry, mountains, etc.&mdash;all
that is comprised in the alphabet through the
mystic virtue of form."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Even more radical is
G&eacute;rard de Nerval (who, moreover, was frequently
subject to hallucinations): "At certain times everything
takes on for me a new aspect&mdash;secret voices
come out of plant, tree, animals, from the humblest
insects, to caution and encourage me. Formless and
lifeless objects have mysterious turns the meaning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of which I understand." To others, contemporaries,
"the real world is a fairy land."</p>

<p>The middle ages&mdash;a period of lively imagination
and slight rational culture&mdash;overflowed in this direction.
"Many thought that on this earth everything
is a sign, a figure, and that the visible is worth
nothing except insofar as it covers up the invisible."
Plants, animals&mdash;there is nothing that does not
become subject for interpretation; all the members
of the body are emblems; the head is Christ, the
hairs are the saints, the legs are the apostles, the
eye is contemplation, etc. There are extant special
books in which all that is seriously explained. Who
does not know the symbolism of the cathedrals, and
the vagaries to which it has given rise? The towers
are prayer, the columns the apostles, the stones and
the mortar the assembly of the faithful; the windows
are the organs of sense, the buttresses and abutments
are the divine assistance; and so on to the
minutest detail.</p>

<p>In our day of intense intellectual development, it
is not given to many to return sincerely to a mental
condition that recalls that of the earliest times. Even
if we come near it, we still find a difference. Primitive
man puts life, consciousness, activity, into
everything; symbolism does likewise, but it does not
believe in an autonomous, distinct, particular soul
inherent in each thing. The absence of abstraction
and generalization, characteristic of humanity in its
early beginnings, when it peoples the world with
myriads of animate beings, has disappeared. Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
source of activity revealed by symbols appears as a
fragmentary manifestation; it descends from a
single primary, personal or impersonal, spring. At
the root of this imaginative construction there is
always either theism or pantheism.</p>

<p>(2) Mystical imagination has often and erroneously
been identified with religious imagination.
Although it may be held that every religion, no
matter how dull and poor, presupposes a latent
mysticism, because it supposes an Unknown beyond
the reach of sense, there are religions very slightly
mystical in fact&mdash;those of savages, strictly utilitarian;
among barbarians, the martial cults of the
Germans and the Aztecs; among civilized races,
Rome and Greece.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> However, even though the
mystic imagination is not confined to the bounds of
religious thought, history shows us that there it
attains its completest expansion.</p>

<p>To be brief, and to keep strictly within our subject,
let us note that in the completely developed
great religions there has arisen opposition between
the rationalists and the imaginative expounders,
between the dogmatists and the mystics. The former,
rational architects, build by means of abstract
ideas, logical relations and methods, by deduction
and induction; the others, imaginative builders, care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
little for this learned magnificence&mdash;they excel in
vivid creations because the moving energy with
them is in their feelings, "in their hearts;" because
they speak a language made up of concrete images,
and consequently their wholly symbolic speech is at
the same time an original construction. The mystic
imagination is a transformation of the mythic
imagination, the myth changing into symbols. It
cannot escape the necessity of this. On the other
hand, the affective states cannot longer remain
vague, diffuse, purely internal; they must become
fixed in time and space, and condensed into images
forming a personality, legend, event, or rite. Thus,
Buddha represents the tendencies towards pity and
resignation, summing up the aspirations for final
rest. On the other hand, abstract ideas, pure concepts,
being repugnant to the mystic's nature, it is
also necessary that they take on images through
which they may be seen&mdash;e.g., the relations between
God and man, in the various forms of communion;
the idea of divine protection in incarnations, mediators,
etc. But the images made use of are not dry
and colorless like words that by long use have lost
all direct representative value and are merely marks
or tags. Being symbolic, i.e., concrete, they are, as
we have seen, direct substitutes for reality, and they
differ as much from words as sketching and drawing
differ from our alphabetical signs, which are, however,
their derivatives or abbreviations.</p>

<p>It must, however, be noted that if "the mystic
fact is a na&iuml;ve effort to apprehend the absolute, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
mode of symbolic, not dialectic, thinking, that lives
on symbols and finds in them the only fitting expression,"<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
it seems that this imaginative phase has been
to some minds only an internal form, for they have
attempted to go beyond it through ecstacy, aspiring
to grasp the ultimate principle as a pure unity, without
image and without form,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> which metaphysical
realism hopes to attain by other methods and by a
different route. However interesting they may be
for psychology, these attempts, luring one on further
and further, by their seeming or real elimination of
every symbolic element, become foreign to our subject,
and we cannot consider them at greater length
here.</p>

<p>(3) "History shows that philosophy has done
nothing but transform ideas of mystic production,
substituting for the form of images and undemonstrated
statements the form of assertions of a
rational system."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> This declaration of a metaphysician
saves us from dwelling on the subject long.</p>

<p>When we seek the difference between religious
and metaphysical or philosophical symbolism, we
find it in the nature of the constitutive elements.
Turned in the direction of religion, mystic symbolism
presupposes two principal elements&mdash;imagination
and feeling; turned in a metaphysical direction, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
presupposes imagination and a very small rational
element. This substitution involves appreciable deviation
from the primitive type. The construction is
of greater logical regularity. Besides, and this is
the important characteristic, the subject-matter&mdash;though
still resembling symbolic images&mdash;tends to
become concepts: such are vivified abstractions,
allegorical beings, hereditary entities of spirits and
of gods. In short, metaphysical mysticism is a
transition-form towards metaphysical rationalism,
although these two tendencies have always been
inimical in the history of philosophy, just as in the
history of religion.</p>

<p>In this imaginative plan of the world we may
recognize stages according to the increasing weakness
of the systems, depending on the number and
quality of the hypotheses. For example, the progression
is apparent between Plotinus and the frenzied
creations of the Gnostics and the Cabalists.
With the latter, we come into a world of unbridled
fancy which, in place of human romances, invents
cosmic romances. Here appear the allegorical
beings mentioned above, half concept, half symbol;
the ten Sephiros of the Cabala, immutable forms of
being; the <i>syzygies</i> or couples of Gnosticism&mdash;soul
and reflection, depth and silence, reason and life,
inspiration and truth, etc.; the absolute manifesting
itself by the unfolding of fifty-two attributes, each
unfolding comprising seven <i>eons</i>, corresponding to
the 364 days of the year, etc. It would be wearisome
to follow these extravagant thoughts, which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
though the learned may treat them with some
respect, have for the psychologist only the interest
of pathologic evidence. Moreover, this form of
mystic imagination presents too little that is new
for us to speak of it without repeating ourselves.</p>

<p>To conclude: The mystic imagination, in its
alluring freedom, its variety, and its richness, is
second to no form, not even to esthetic invention,
which, according to common prejudice, is the type
<i>par excellence</i>. Following the most venturesome
methods of analogy, it has constructed conceptions
of the world made up almost wholly of feelings and
images&mdash;symbolic architectures.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE SCIENTIFIC IMAGINATION</h3>


<p>It is quite generally recognized that imagination
is indispensable in all sciences; that without it we
could only copy, repeat, imitate; that it is a stimulus
driving us onward and launching us into the unknown.
If there does exist a very widespread prejudice
to the contrary&mdash;if many hold that scientific
culture throttles imagination&mdash;we must look for the
explanation of this view first, in the equivocation,
pointed out several times, that makes the essence of
the creative imagination consist of images, which
are here most often replaced by abstractions or
extracts of things&mdash;whence it results that the created
work does not have the living forms of religion, of
art, or even of mechanical invention; and then, in
the rational requirements regulating the development
of the creative faculty&mdash;it may not wander at
will. In either case its end is determined, and in
order to exist, i.e., in order to be accepted, the
invention must become subject to pre&euml;stablished
rules.</p>

<p>This variety of imagination being, after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
esthetic form, the one that psychologists have best
described, we may therefore be brief. A complete
study of the subject, however, remains yet to be
made. Indeed, we may remark that there is no
"scientific imagination" in general, that its form
must vary according to the nature of the science,
and that, consequently, it really resolves itself into
a certain number of genera and even of species.
Whence arises the need of monographs, each one of
which should be the work of a competent man.</p>

<p>No one will question that mathematicians have a
way of thinking all their own; but even this is too
general. The arithmetician, the algebraist, and
more generally the analyst, in whom invention obtains
in the most abstract form of discontinuous
functions&mdash;symbols and their relations&mdash;cannot
imagine like the geometrician. One may well speak
of the ideal figures of geometry&mdash;the empirical
origin of which is no longer anywhere contested&mdash;but
we cannot escape from representing them as
somehow in space. Does anyone think that Monge,
the creator of descriptive geometry, who by his
work has aided builders, architects, mechanics, stone
cutters in their labors, could have the same type of
imagination as the mathematician who has been
given up all his life to the theory of number? Here,
then, are at least two well-marked varieties, to say
nothing of mixed forms. The physicist's imagination
is necessarily more concrete; since he is incessantly
obliged to refer to the data of sense or to
that totality of visual, tactile, motor, acoustic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
thermic, etc., representations that we term the
"properties of matter." Our eye, says Tyndall,
cannot see sound waves contract and dilate, but we
construct them in thought&mdash;i.e., by means of
visual images. The same remarks are true of chemists.
The founders of the atomic theory certainly
<i>saw</i> atoms, and pictured them in the mind's eye, and
their arrangement in compound bodies. The complexity
of the imagination increases still more in the
geologist, the botanist, the zoologist; it approaches
more and more, with its increasing details, to the
level of perception. The physician, in whom science
becomes also an art, has need of visual representations
of the exterior and interior, microscopic and
macroscopic, of the various forms of diseased conditions;
auditory representations (auscultation); tactile
representations (touch, reverberation, etc.); and
let us also add that we are not speaking merely of
diagnosis of diseases, which is a matter of reproductive
imagination, but of the discovery of a new
pathologic "entity," proven and made certain from
the symptoms. Lastly, if we do not hesitate to give
a very broad extension to the term "scientific," and
apply it also to invention in social matters, we shall
see that the latter is still more exacting, for one must
represent to oneself not only the elements of the
past and of the present, but in addition construct a
picture of the future according to probable inductions
and deductions.</p>

<p>It might be objected that the foregoing enumeration
proves a great variety in the <i>content</i> of creative<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
imagination but not in the imagination itself, and
that nothing has proven that, under all these various
aspects, there does not exist a so-called scientific
imagination, that always remains identical. This
position is untenable. For we have seen above<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> that
there exists no creative instinct in general, no one
mere indeterminate "creative power," but only wants
that, in certain cases, excite novel combinations of
images. The nature of the separable materials, then,
is a factor of the first importance; it is determining,
and indicates to the mind the direction in which it
is turned, and all treason in this regard is paid for
by aborted construction, by painful labor for some
petty result. Invention, separated from what gives
it body and soul, is nothing but a pure abstraction.</p>

<p>The monographs called for above would, then, be
a not unneeded work. It is only from them collectively
that the r&ocirc;le of the imagination in the
sciences could be completely shown, and we might
by abstraction separate out the characters common
to all varieties&mdash;the essential marks of this imaginative
type.</p>

<p>Mathematics aside, all the sciences dealing with
facts&mdash;from astronomy to sociology&mdash;suppose three
moments, namely, observation, conjecture, verification.
The first depends on external and internal
sense, the second on the creative imagination, the
third on rational operations, although the imagination
is not entirely barred from it. In order to
study its influence on scientific development, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
shall study it (a) in the sciences in process of
formation; (b) in the established sciences; (c) in
the processes of verification.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It has often been said that the perfection of a
science is measured by the amount of mathematics
it requires; we might say, conversely, that its lack
of completeness is measured by the amount of
imagination that it includes. It is a psychological
necessity. Where the human mind cannot explain
or prove, there it invents; preferring a semblance
of knowledge to its total absence.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Imagination
fulfills the function of a substitute; it furnishes a
subjective, conjectural solution in place of an objective,
rational explanation. This substitution has
degrees:</p>

<p>(1) The sway of the imagination is almost complete
in the pseudo-sciences (alchemy, astrology,
magic, occultism, etc.), which it would be more
proper to call embryonic sciences, for they were the
beginnings of more exact disciplines and their fancies
have not been without use. In the history of
science, this is the golden age of the creative imagination,
corresponding to the myth-making period
already studied.</p>

<p>(2) The semi-sciences, incompletely proved (certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>portions of biology, psychology, sociology,
etc.), although they show a regression of imaginative
explanation repulsed by the hitherto absent or
insufficient experimentation, nevertheless abound in
hypotheses, that succeed, contradict, destroy one
another. It is a commonplace truism that does not
need to be dwelt on&mdash;they furnish <i>ad libitum</i>
examples of what has been rightly termed scientific
mythology.</p>

<p>Aside from the quantity of imagination expended,
often without great profit, there is another character
to be noted&mdash;the nature of the belief that accompanies
imaginative creation. We have already seen
repeatedly that the intensity of the imaginary conception
is in direct ratio to the accompanying belief,
or rather, that the two phenomena are really one&mdash;merely
the two aspects of one and the same state of
consciousness. But faith&mdash;i.e., the adherence of
the mind to an undemonstrated assertion&mdash;is here at
its maximum.</p>

<p>There are in the sciences hypotheses that are not
believed in, that are preserved for their didactic
usefulness, because they furnish a simple and convenient
method of explanation. Thus the "properties
of matter" (heat, electricity, magnetism, etc.),
regarded by physicists as distinct qualities even in
the first half of the last century; the "two electric
fluids;" cohesion, affinity, etc., in chemistry&mdash;these
are some of the convenient and admitted expressions
to which, however, we attach no explanatory value.</p>

<p>There is also to be mentioned the hypothesis held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
as an approximation of reality&mdash;this is the truly
scientific position. It is accompanied by a provisional
and ever-revocable belief. This is admitted,
in principle at least, by all scientists, and has been
put into practice by many of them.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the hypothesis regarded as the
truth itself&mdash;one that is accompanied by a complete,
absolute, belief. But daily observation and history
show us that in the realm of embryonic and ill-proven
sciences this disposition is more flourishing
than anywhere else. <i>The less proof there is, the
more we believe.</i> This attitude, however wrong
from the standpoint of the logician, seems to the
psychologist natural. The mind clings tenaciously
to the hypothesis because the latter is its own creation,
or, because in adopting it, it seems to the mind
that it should have itself discovered the hypothesis,
so much does the latter harmonize with its inner
states. Let us take the hypothesis of evolution, for
example: we need not mention its high philosophical
bearing, and the immense influence that it exerts on
almost all forms of human thought. Nevertheless,
it still remains an hypothesis; but for many it is an
indisputable and inviolable dogma, raised far above
all controversy. They accept it with the uncompromising
fervor of believers: a new proof of the
underlying connection between imagination and
belief&mdash;they increase and decrease <i>pari passu</i>.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Should we assign as belonging solely to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
imagination every invention or discovery&mdash;in a
word, whatever is new&mdash;in the well-organized
sciences that form a body of solid, constantly-broadening
doctrine? It is a hard question. That
which raises scientific knowledge above popular
knowledge is the use of an experimental method and
rigorous reasoning processes; but, is not induction
and deduction going from the known to the unknown?
Without desiring to depreciate the method
and its value, it must nevertheless be admitted that
it is preventive, not inventive. It resembles, says
Condillac, the parapets of a bridge, which do not
help the traveler to walk, but keep him from falling
over. It is of value especially as a habit of mind.
People have wisely discoursed on the "methods" of
invention. There are none; but for which fact we
could manufacture inventors just as we make
mechanics and watchmakers. It is the imagination
that invents, that provides the rational faculties with
their materials, with the position, and even the solution
of their problems. Reasoning is only a means
for control and proof; it transforms the work of the
imagination into acceptable, logical results. If one
has not imagined beforehand, the logical method is
aimless and useless, for we cannot reason concerning
the completely unknown. Even when a problem
seems to advance towards solution wholly through
the reason, the imagination ceaselessly intervenes in
the form of a succession of groupings, trials,
guesses, and possibilities that it proposes. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
function of method is to determine its value, to
accept or reject it.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>Let us show by a few examples that conjecture,
the work of the combining imagination, is at the
root of the most diverse scientific inventions.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Every mathematical invention is at first only an
hypothesis that must be demonstrated, i.e., must
be brought under previously established general
principles: prior to the decisive moment of rational
verification it is only a thing imagined. "In a
conversation concerning the place of imagination in
scientific work," says Liebig, "a great French
mathematician expressed the opinion to me that the
greater part of mathematical truth is acquired not
through deduction, but through the imagination.
He might have said 'all the mathematical truths,'
without being wrong." We know that Pascal discovered
the thirty-second proposition of Euclid all
by himself. It is true that it has been concluded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
wrongly perhaps, that he had also discovered all
the earlier ones, the order followed by the Greek
geometrician not being necessary, and not excluding
other arrangements. However it be, reasoning alone
was not enough for that discovery. "Many people,"
says Naville, "of whom I am one, might have
thought hard all their lives without finding out the
thirty-two propositions of Euclid." This fact alone
shows clearly the difference between invention and
demonstration, imagination and reason.</p>

<p>In the sciences dealing with facts, all the best-established
experimental truths have passed through
a conjectural stage. History permits no doubt on
this point. What makes it appear otherwise is the
fact that for centuries there has gradually come to
be formed a body of solid belief, making a whole,
stored away in classic treatises from which we learn
from childhood, and in which they seem to be arranged
of themselves. We are not told of the series
of checks and failures through which<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> they have
passed. Innumerable are the inventions that remained
for a long time in a state of conjecture,
matters of pure imagination, because various circumstances
did not permit them to take shape, to
be demonstrated and verified. Thus, in the thirteenth
century, Roger Bacon had a very clear idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of a construction on rails similar to our railroads;
of optical instruments that would permit, as does
the telescope, to see very far, and to discover the
invisible. It is even claimed that he must have
foreseen the phenomena of interferences, the demonstration
of which had to be awaited ten centuries.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are guesses that have
met success without much delay, but in which the
imaginative phase&mdash;that of the invention preceding
all demonstration&mdash;is easy to locate. We know that
Tycho-Brah&eacute;, lacking inventive genius but rich in
capacity for exact observation, met Kepler, an
adventurous spirit: together, the two made a complete
scientist. We have seen how Kepler, guided
by a preconceived notion of the "harmony of the
spheres," after many trials and corrections, ended
by discovering his laws. Copernicus recognized
expressly that his theory was suggested to him by
an hypothesis of Pythagoras&mdash;that of a revolution
of the earth about a central fire, assumed to be in
a fixed position. Newton imagined his hypothesis
of gravitation from the year 1666 on, then abandoned
it, the result of his calculations disagreeing
with observation; finally he took it up again after a
lapse of a few years, having obtained from Paris
the new measure of the terrestrial meridian that
permitted him to prove his guess. In relating his
discoveries, Lavoisier is lavish in expressions that
leave no doubt as to their originally conjectural
character. "He <i>suspects</i> that the air of the atmosphere
is not a simple thing, but is composed of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
very different substances." "He <i>presumes</i> that the
permanent alkalies (potash, soda) and the earths
(lime, magnesia) should not be considered simple
substances." And he adds: "What I present here
is at the most no more than a mere <i>conjecture</i>."
We have mentioned above the case of Darwin. Besides,
the history of scientific discoveries is full of
facts of this sort.</p>

<p>The passage from the imaginative to the rational
phase may be slow or sudden. "For eight months,"
says Kepler, "I have seen a first glimmer; for three
months, daylight; for the last week I see the sunlight
of the most wonderful contemplation." On
the other hand, Ha&uuml;y drops a bit of crystallized calcium
spar, and, looking at one of the broken prisms,
cries out, "All is found!" and immediately verifies
his quick intuition in regard to the true nature of
crystallization. We have already indicated<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> the psychological
reasons for these differences.</p>

<p>Underneath all the reasoning, inductions, deductions,
calculations, demonstrations, methods, and
logical apparatus of every sort, there is something
animating them that is not understood, that is the
work of that complex operation&mdash;the constructive
imagination.</p>

<p>To conclude: The hypothesis is a creation of the
mind, invested with a provisional reality that may,
after verification, become permanent. False hypotheses
are characterized as imaginary, by which
designation is meant that they have not become freed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
from the first state. But for psychology they are
different neither in their origin nor in their nature
from those scientific hypotheses that, subjected to
the power of reason or of experiment, have come out
victorious. Besides, in addition to abortive
hypotheses, there are dethroned ones. What theory
was more clinging, more fascinating in its applications,
than that of phlogiston? Kant<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> praised it as
one of the greatest discoveries of the eighteenth century.
The development of the sciences is replete
with these downfalls. They are psychological regressions:
the invention, considered for a time as
adequate to reality, decays, returns to the imaginative
phase whence it seems to have emerged, and
remains pure imagination.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Imagination is not absent from the third stage of
scientific research, in demonstration and experimentation,
but here we must be brief, (1) because it
passes to a minor place, yielding its rank to other
modes of investigation, and (2) because this study
would have to become doubly employed with the
practical and mechanical imagination, which will
occupy our attention later. The imagination is here
only an auxiliary, a useful instrument, serving:</p>

<p>(1) In the sciences of reasoning, to discover ingenious
methods of demonstration, stratagems for
avoiding or overcoming difficulties.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) In the experimental sciences for inventing
methods of research or of control&mdash;whence its analogy,
above mentioned, to the practical imagination.
Furthermore, the reciprocal influence of these two
forms of imagination is a matter of common observation:
a scientific discovery permits the invention
of new instruments; the invention of new instruments
makes possible experiments that are increasingly
more complicated and delicate.</p>

<p>One remark further: This constructive imagination
at the third stage is the only one met with in
many scientists. They lack genius for invention,
but discover details, additions, corrections, improvements.
A recent author distinguishes (a) those
who have created the hypothesis, prepared the experiments,
and imagined the appropriate apparatus;
(b) those who have imagined the hypothesis and the
experiment, but use means already invented; and
(c) those who, having found the hypothesis made
and demonstrated, have thought out a new method
of verification.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The scientific imagination becomes
poorer as we follow it down this scale, which, however,
bears no relation to exactness of reasoning and
firmness of method.</p>

<p>Neglecting species and varieties, we may reduce
the fundamental characters of the scientific imagination
to the following:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>For its material, it has concepts, the degree of
abstraction of which varies with the nature of the
science.</p>

<p>It employs only those associational forms that
have an objective basis, although its mission is to
form new combinations, "the discoveries consisting
of the relation of ideas, capable of being united,
which hitherto have been isolated."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> (Laplace.)
All association with an affective basis is strictly excluded.</p>

<p>It aims toward objectivity: in its conjectural construction
it attempts to reproduce the order and connection
of things. Whence its natural affinity for
realistic art, which is midway between fiction and
reality.</p>

<p>It is unifying, and so just the opposite of the
esthetic imagination, which is rather developmental.
It puts forward the master idea (Claude Bernard's
<i>id&eacute;e directrice</i>), a center of attraction and impulse
that enlivens the entire work. The principle of
unity, without which no creation succeeds, is nowhere
more visible than in the scientific imagination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Even when illusory, it is useful. Pasteur, scrupulous
scientist that he was, did not hesitate to say:
"The experimenter's illusions are a part of his
power: they are the preconceived ideas serving as
guides for him."</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>It does not seem to me wrong to regard the
imagination of the metaphysician as a variety of
the scientific imagination. Both arise from one and
the same requirement. Several times before this
we have emphasized this point&mdash;that the various
forms of imagination are not the work of an alleged
"creative instinct," but that each particular one has
arisen from a special need. The scientific imagination
has for its prime motive the need of <i>partial</i>
knowledge or explanation; the metaphysical imagination
has for its prime motive the need of a <i>total</i>
or complete explanation. The latter is no longer an
endeavor on a restricted group of phenomena, but
a conjecture as to the totality of things, as aspiration
toward completely unified knowledge, a need
of final explanation that, for certain minds, is just
as imperious as any other need.</p>

<p>This necessity is expressed by the creation of a
cosmic or human hypothesis constructed after the
type and methods of scientific hypotheses, but radically
subjective in its origin&mdash;only apparently objective.
<i>It is a rationalized myth.</i></p>

<p>The three moments requisite for the constitution
of a science are found here, but in a modified form:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
reflection replaces observation, the choice of the
hypothesis becomes all-important, and its application
to everything corresponds to scientific proof.</p>

<p>(1) The first moment or preparatory stage, does
not belong to our subject. It requires, however, a
word in passing. In all science, whether well or ill
established, firm or weak, we start from facts derived
from observation or experiment. Here, facts
are replaced by general ideas. The terminus of
every science is, then, the starting-point of philosophical
speculation:&mdash;metaphysics begins where
each separate science ends; and the limits of the latter
are theories, hypotheses. These hypotheses become
working material for metaphysics which, consequently,
is an hypothesis built on hypotheses, a
conjecture grafted on conjecture, a work of imagination
superimposed on works of imagination. Its
principal source, then, is imagination, to which reflection
applies itself.</p>

<p>Metaphysicians, indeed, hold that the object of
their researches, far from being symbolic and abstract,
as in science, or fictitious and imaginary,
as in art, is the very essence of things,&mdash;absolute
reality. Unfortunately, they have never proven that
it suffices to seek in order to find, and to wish in
order to get.</p>

<p>(2) The second stage is critical. It is concerned
with finding the principle that rules and explains
everything. In the invention of his theory the metaphysician
gives his measure, and permits us to value
his imaginative power. But the hypothesis, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
in science is always provisional and revocable, is
here the supreme reality, the fixed position, the <i>inconcussum
quid</i>.</p>

<p>The choice of the principle depends on several
causes: The chief of these is the creator's individuality.
Every metaphysician has a point of view,
a personal way of contemplating and interpreting the
totality of things, a belief that tends to recruit adherents.</p>

<p>Secondary causes are: the influence of earlier systems,
the sum of acquired knowledge, the social
<i>milieu</i>, the variable predominance of religions,
sciences, morality, esthetic culture.</p>

<p>Without troubling ourselves with classifications,
otherwise very numerous, into which we may group
systems (idealism, materialism, monism, etc.) we
shall, for our purpose, divide metaphysicians into
the imaginative and rational, according as the
imagination is superior to the reason or the reason
rules the imagination. The differences between
these two types of mind, already clearly shown in the
choice of the hypothesis, are proven in its development.</p>

<p>(3) The fundamental principle, indeed, must
come out of its state of involution and justify its
universal validity by explaining everything. This
is the third moment, when the scientific process of
verification is replaced by a process of construction.</p>

<p>All imaginative metaphysics have a dynamic basis,
e.g., the Platonic <i>Ideas</i>, Leibniz' <i>Monadology</i>, the
<i>Nature-philosophy</i> of Schelling, Schopenhauer's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
<i>Will</i>, and Hartmann's <i>Unconscious</i>, the mystics, the
systems that assume a world-soul, etc. Semi-abstract,
semi-poetic constructions, they are permeated
with imagination not only in the general conception,
but also in the numberless details of its application.
Such are the "fulgurations" of Leibniz, those very
rich digressions of Schopenhauer, etc. They have
the fascination of a work of art as much as that of
science, and this is no longer questioned by metaphysicians
themselves;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> they are living things.</p>

<p>Rational metaphysics, on the other hand, have a
chilly aspect, which brings them nearer the abstract
sciences. Such are most of the mechanical conceptions,
the Hegelian <i>Dialectic</i>, Spinoza's construction
<i>more geometrico</i>, the <i>Summa</i> of the Middle
Ages. These are buildings of concepts solidly cemented
together with logical relations. But art is
not wholly absent; it is seen in the systematic concatenation,
in the beautiful ordering, in the symmetry
of division, in the skill with which the generative
principle is constantly brought in, in showing
it ever-present, explaining everything. It has been
possible to compare these systems with the architecture
of the Gothic cathedrals, in which the dominant
idea is incessantly repeated in the numberless
details of the construction, and in the branching
multiplicity of ornamentation.</p>

<p>Further, whatever view we adopt as to its ultimate
value, it must be recognized that the imagination
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>of the great metaphysicians, by the originality
and fearlessness of its conceptions, by its skill in
perfecting all parts of its work, is inferior to no
other form. It is equal to the highest, if it does not
indeed surpass them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE PRACTICAL AND MECHANICAL IMAGINATION</h3>


<p>The study of the practical imagination is not
without difficulties. First of all, it has not hitherto
attracted psychologists, so that we enter the field
at random, and wander unguided in an unexplored
region. But the principal obstacle is in the lack of
determination of this form of imagination, and in
the absence of boundary lines. Where does it begin,
and where does it end? Penetrating all our
life even in its least details, it is likely to lead us
astray through the diversity, often insignificant, of
its manifestations. To convince ourselves of this
fact, let us take a man regarded as least imaginative:&mdash;subtract
the moments when his consciousness
is busied with perceptions, memories,
emotions, logical thought and action&mdash;all the rest
of his mental life must be put down to the credit
of the imagination. Even thus limited, this function
is not a negligible quantity:&mdash;it includes the
plans and constructions for the future, and all the
dreams of escaping from the present; and there is
no man but makes such. This had to be mentioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
on account of its very triteness, because it is often
forgotten, and consequently the field of the creative
imagination is unduly restricted, being limited little
by little to exceptional cases.</p>

<p>It must, however, be recognized that these small
facts teach us little. Consequently, following our
adopted procedure, dwelling longest on the clearer
and more evident cases in which the work of creating
appears distinctly, we shall rapidly pass over
the lower forms of the practical imagination, in order
to dwell on the higher form&mdash;technical or mechanical
imagination.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>If we take an ordinary imaginative person,&mdash;understanding
by this expression, one whom his nature
singles out for no special invention&mdash;we see that
he excels in the small inventions, adapted for a
moment, for a detail, for the petty needs constantly
arising in human life. It is a fruitful, ingenious, industrious
mind, one that knows how to "take hold
of things." The active, enterprising American, capable
of passing from one occupation to another according
to circumstances, opportunity, or imagined
profits, furnishes a good example.</p>

<p>If we descend from this form of sane imagination
toward the morbid forms, we meet first the
unstable&mdash;knights of industry, hunters of adventure,
inventors frequently of questionable means,
people hungry for change, always imagining what
they haven't, trying in turn all professions, becoming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>workmen, soldiers, sailors, merchants, etc., not
from expediency, but from natural instability.</p>

<p>Further down are found the acknowledged
"freaks" at the brink of insanity, who are but the
extreme form of the unstable, and who, after having
wasted haphazard much useless imagination, end
in an insane asylum or worse still.</p>

<p>Let us consider these three groups together. Let
us eliminate the intellectual and moral qualities
characteristic of each group, which establish notable
differences between them, and let us consider only
their inventive capacity as applied to practical life.
One character common to all is mobility&mdash;the tendency
to change. It is a matter of current observation
that men of lively imagination are changeable.
Common opinion, which is also the opinion of moralists
and of most psychologists, attributes this mobility,
this instability, to the imagination. This, in
my opinion, is just upside down. <i>It is not because
they have an active imagination that they are
changeable, but it is because they are changeable that
their imagination is active.</i> We thus return to the
<i>motor</i> basis of all creative work. Each new or
merely modified disposition becomes a center of attraction
and pull. Doubtless the inner push is a
necessary condition, but it is not sufficient. If
there were not within them a sufficient number of
concrete, abstract, or semi-abstract representations,
susceptible of various combinations, nothing would
happen; but the origin of invention and of its frequent
or constant changes of direction lies in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
emotional and motor constitution, not in the quantity
or quality of representations. I shall not dwell
longer on a subject already treated,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> but it was
proper to show, in passing, that common opinion
starts from an erroneous conception of the primary
conditions of invention&mdash;whether great or small,
speculative or practical.</p>

<p>In the immense empire of the practical imagination,
superstitious beliefs form a goodly province.</p>

<p>What is superstition? By what positive signs
do we recognize it? An exact definition and a sure
criterion are impossible. It is a flitting notion that
depends on the times, places, and nature of minds.
Has it not often been said that the religion of one
is superstition to another, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>? This,
too, is only a single instance from among many
others; for the common opinion that restricts superstition
within the bounds of religious faith is an incomplete
view. There are peculiar beliefs, foreign
to every dogma and every religious feeling, from
which the most radical freethinker is not exempt;
for example, the superstitions of gamblers. Indeed,
at the bottom of all such beliefs, we always find the
vague, semi-conscious notion of a mysterious power&mdash;destiny,
fate, chance.</p>

<p>Without taking the trouble to set arbitrary limits,
let us take the facts as they are, without possible
question, i.e., imaginary creations, subjective fancies,
having reality only for those admitting them.
Even a summary collection of past and present superstitions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>would fill a library. Aside from those
having a frankly religious mark, others almost as
numerous surround civil life, birth, marriage, death,
appearance and healing of diseases, <i>dies fasti atque
nefasti</i>, propitious or fateful words, auguries drawn
from the meeting or acts of certain animals. The
list would be endless.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>All that can be attempted here is a determination
of the principal condition of that state of mind,
the psychology of which is in the last analysis very
simple. We shall thus answer in an indirect and
incomplete manner the question of criterion.</p>

<p>First, since we hold that the origin of all imaginative
creation is a need, a desire, a tendency, where
then is the origin of that inexhaustible fount of
fancies? <i>In the instinct for individual preservation</i>,
orientated in the direction of the future. Man
seeks to divine future events, and by various means
to act on the order of things to modify it for his
own advantage or to appease his evil fate.</p>

<p>As for the mental mechanism that, set in motion
by this desire, produces the vain images of the
superstitious, it implies:</p>

<p>(1) A deep idea of causality, reduced to a <i>post
hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>. Herodotus says of the Egyptian
priests: "They have discovered more prodigies
and presages than any other people, because, when
some extraordinary thing appears, they note it as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
well as all the events following it, so that if a similar
prodigy appears anew, they expect to see the
same events reproduced." It is the hypothesis of an
indissoluble association between two or more events,
assumed without verification, without criticism. This
manner of thinking depends on the weakness of the
logical faculties or on the excessive influence of the
feelings.</p>

<p>(2) The abuse of reasoning by analogy. This
great artisan of the imagination is satisfied with
likenesses so vague and agreements so strange, that
it dares everything. Resemblance is no longer a
quality of things imposed on the mind, but an hypothesis
of the mind imposed on things. Astrology
groups into "constellations" stars that are billions of
miles apart, believes that it discovers there an animal
shape, human or any other, and deduces therefrom
alleged "influences." This star is reddish
(Mars), sign of blood; this other is of a pure, brilliant
silvery light (Venus) or livid (Saturn), and
acts in a different way. We know what clever
structures of conjectures and prognoses have been
built on these foundations. Need we mention the
Middle Age practice of charms, which even in our
day still has adherents among cultured people?
The physicians of the time of Charles II, says Lang,
gave their patients "mummy powder" (pulverized
mummies) because the mummies, having lasted a
long time, must prolong life.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Gold in solution has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
been esteemed as a medicine&mdash;gold, being a perfect
substance, should produce perfect health. In
order to get rid of a disease nothing is more frequent
among primitive men than to picture the sick
person on wood or on the ground, and to strike
the injured part with an arrow or knife, in order
to annihilate the sickening principle.</p>

<p>(3) Finally, there is the magic influence ascribed
to certain words. It is the triumph of the theory
of <i>nomina numina</i>; we need not return to it. But
the working of the mind on words, erecting them
into entities, conferring life and power on them&mdash;in
a word, the activity that creates myths and is
the final basis of all constructive imagination&mdash;appears
also here.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Up to this point we have considered the practical
imagination only in its somewhat petty aspect in
small inventions or as semi-morbid in superstitious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
fancies. We now come to its higher form, mechanical
invention.</p>

<p>This subject has not been studied by psychologists.
Not that they have misunderstood its r&ocirc;le, which
is, after all, very evident; but they limit themselves
to speak of it cursorily, without emphasizing it.</p>

<p>In order to appreciate its importance, I see no
other way than to put ourselves face to face with
the works that it has produced, to question the history
of discovery and useful arts, to profit by the
disclosures of inventors and their biographers.</p>

<p>Of a work of this kind, which would be very long
because the materials are scattered, we can give here
only a rough sketch, merely to take therefrom what
is of interest for psychology and what teaches us
in regard to the characters peculiar to this type of
imagination.</p>

<p>The erroneous view that opposes imagination to
the useful, and claims that they are mutually exclusive,
is so widespread and so persistent, that we
shall seem to many to be expressing a paradox when
we say that if we could strike the balance of the
imagination that man has spent and made permanent
in esthetic life on the one hand, and in technical
and mechanical invention on the other, the
balance would be in favor of the latter. This assertion,
however, will not seem paradoxical to those
who have considered the question. Why, then, the
view above mentioned? Why are people inclined
to believe that our present subject, if not entirely
foreign to the imagination, is only an impoverished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
form of it? I account for it by the following reasons:</p>

<p>Esthetic imagination, when fully complete, is
simply <i>fixed</i>, i.e., remains a fictitious matter recognized
as such. It has a frankly subjective, personal
character, arbitrary in its choice of means. A work
of art&mdash;a poem, a novel, a drama, an opera, a picture,
a statue&mdash;might have been otherwise than it
is. It is possible to modify the general plan, to
add or reduce an episode, to change an ending.
The novelist who in the course of his work changes
his characters; the dramatic author who, in deference
to public sentiment, substitutes a happy <i>deno&ucirc;ement</i>
in place of a catastrophe, furnish na&iuml;ve
testimony of this freedom of imagination. Moreover,
artistic creation, expressing itself in words,
sounds, lines, forms, colors, is cast in a mould that
allows it only a feeble "material" reality.</p>

<p>The mechanical imagination is objective&mdash;it must
be embodied, take on a form that gives it a place
side by side with products of nature. It is arbitrary
neither in its choice nor in its means; it is not a free
creature having its end in itself. In order to succeed,
it is subjected to rigorous physical conditions,
to a determinism. It is at this cost that it becomes
a reality, and as we instinctively establish an antithesis
between the imaginary and the real, it seems
that mechanical invention is outside the realm of the
imagination. Moreover, it requires the constant
intervention of calculation, of reasoning, and lastly,
of a manual operation of supreme importance. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
may say without exaggerating that the success of
many mechanical creations depends on the skillful
manipulation of materials. But this last moment,
because it is decisive, should not make us forget its
antecedents, especially the initial moment, which is,
for psychology, similar to all other instances of invention,
when the idea arises, tending to become
objective.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the differences here pointed out between
the two forms of imagination&mdash;esthetic and
mechanical&mdash;are but relative. The former is not
independent of technical apprenticeship, often of
long duration (e.g., in music, sculpture, painting).
As for the latter, we should not exaggerate its determinism.
Often the same end can be reached by
different inventions&mdash;by means differently imagined,
through different mental constructions; and it follows
that, after all allowances are made, these differently
realized imaginations are equally useful.</p>

<p>The difference between the two types is found in
the nature of the need or desire stimulating the invention,
and secondly in the nature of the materials
employed. Others have confounded two distinct
things&mdash;liberty of imagination, which belongs rather
to esthetic creation, and quality and power of imagination,
which may be identical in both cases.</p>

<p>I have questioned certain inventors very skillful in
mechanics, addressing myself to those, preferably,
whom I knew to be strangers to any preconceived
psychological theory. Their replies agree, and
prove that the birth and development of mechanical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
invention are very strictly like those found in other
forms of constructive imagination. As an example,
I cite the following statement of an engineer, which
I render literally:</p>

<p>"The so-called creative imagination surely proceeds
in very different ways, according to temperament,
aptitudes, and, in the same individual, following
the mental disposition, the <i>milieu</i>.</p>

<p>"We may, however, as far as regards mechanical
inventions, distinguish four sufficiently clear phases&mdash;the
germ, incubation, flowering, and completion.</p>

<p>"By germ I mean the first idea coming to the
mind to furnish a solution for a problem that the
whole of one's observations, studies, and researches
has put before one, or that, put by another, has
struck one.</p>

<p>"Then comes incubation, often very long and
painful, or, again, even unconscious. Instinctively
as well as voluntarily one brings to the solution of
the problem all the materials that the eyes and ears
can gather.</p>

<p>"When this latent work is sufficiently complete,
the idea suddenly bursts forth, it may be at the end
of a voluntary tension of mind, or on the occasion of
a chance remark, tearing the veil that hides the surmised
image.</p>

<p>"But this image always appears simple and clear.
In order to get the ideal solution into practice, there
is required a struggle against matter, and the bringing
to an issue is the most thankless part of the inventor's
work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"In order to give consistence and body to the idea
caught sight of enthusiastically in an aureole, one
must have patience, a perseverance through all trials.
One must view on all sides the mechanical agencies
that should serve to set the image together, until the
latter has attained the simplicity that alone makes
invention viable. In this work of bringing to a
head, the same spirit of invention and imagination
must be constantly drawn upon for the solution of
all the details, and it is against this arduous requirement
that the great majority of inventors rebel again
and again.</p>

<p>"This is then, I believe, how one may in a general
way understand the genesis of an invention. It follows
from this that here, as almost everywhere, the
imagination acts through association of ideas.</p>

<p>"Thanks to a profound acquaintance with known
mechanical methods, the inventor succeeds, through
association of ideas, in getting novel combinations
producing new effects, towards the realization of
which his mind has in advance been bent."</p>

<p>But for a slightly explored subject, the foregoing
remarks are not enough. It is necessary to determine
more precisely the general and special characters
of this form of imagination.</p>


<h3><i>1. General Characters</i></h3>

<p>I term general characters those that the mechanical
imagination possesses in common with the best
known, least questioned forms of the constructive
imagination. In order to be convinced that, so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
as concerns these characters it does not differ from
the rest, let us take, for the sake of comparison,
esthetic imagination, since it is agreed, rightly or
wrongly, that this is the model <i>par excellence</i>. We
shall see that the essential psychological conditions
coincide in the two instances.</p>

<p>The mechanical imagination thus has like the other
its ideal, i.e., a perfection conceived and put
forward as capable, little by little, of being realized.
The idea is at first hidden; it is, to use our correspondent's
phrase, "the germ," the principle of unity,
center of attraction, that suggests, excites, and
groups appropriate associations of images, in which
it is enwrapped and organized into a structure, an
<i>ensemble</i> of means converging toward a common
end. It thus presupposes a dissociation of experience.
The inventor undoes, decomposes, breaks
up in thought, or makes of experience a tool, an
instrument, a machine, an agency for building anew
with the d&eacute;bris.</p>

<p>The practical imagination is no more foreign to
inspiration than the esthetic imagination. The history
of useful inventions is full of men who suffered
privations, persecution, ruin; who fought to
the bitter end against relatives and friends&mdash;drawn
by the need of creating, fascinated not by the hope
of future gain but by the idea of an imposed mission,
of a destiny they had to fulfill. What more
have poets and artists done? The fixed and irresistible
idea has led more than one to a foreseen
death, as in the discovery of explosives, the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
attempts at lightning conductors, aeronautics, and
many others. Thus, from a true intuition, primitive
civilizations have put on a level great poets
and great inventors, erected into divinities or demi-gods
historical or legendary personages in whom the
genius of discovery is personified:&mdash;among the Hindoos,
Vicavakarma; among the Greeks, Hephaestos,
Prometheus, Triptolemus, Daedalus and Icarus. The
Chinese, despite their dry imagination, have done
the same; and we find the same condition in Egypt,
Assyria, and everywhere. Moreover, the practical
and mechanical arts have passed through a first
period of no-change, during which the artisan, subjected
to fixed rules and an undisputed tradition,
considers himself an instrument of divine revelation.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Little by little he has emerged from that
theological age, to enter the humanistic age, when,
being fully conscious of being the author of his
work, he labors freely, changes and modifies according
to his own inspiration.</p>

<p>Mechanical and industrial imagination, like esthetic
imagination, has its preparatory period, its
zenith and decline: the periods of the precursors, of
the great inventors, and of mere perfectors. At
first a venture is made, effort is wasted with small
result,&mdash;the man has come too early or lacks clear
vision; then a great imaginative mind arises, blossoms;
after him the work passes into the hands of
<i>dii minores</i>, pupils or imitators, who add, abridge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
modify: such is the order. The many-times written
history of the application of steam, from the
time of the eolipile of Hero of Alexandria to the
heroic period of Newcomen and Watt, and the improvements
made since their time, is one proof of
the statement. Another example:&mdash;the machine for
measuring duration is at first a simple clepsydra;
then there are added marks indicating the subdivisions
of time, then a water gauge causes a hand to
move around a dial, then two hands for the hours
and minutes; then comes a great moment&mdash;by the
use of weights the clepsydra becomes a clock, at
first massive and cumbersome, later lightened, becoming
capable, with Tycho-Brah&eacute;, of marking seconds;
and then another moment&mdash;Huyghens invents
the spiral spring to replace the weights, and the
clock, simplified and lightened, becomes the watch.</p>


<h3><i>2. Special Characters</i></h3>

<p>The special characteristics of the mechanical
imagination being the marks belonging to this type,
we shall study them at greater length.</p>

<p>(I) There is first of all, at least in great inventors,
an inborn quality,&mdash;that is, a natural disposition,&mdash;that
does not originate in experience and
owes the latter only its development. This quality
is a bent in a practical, useful direction; a tendency
to act, not in the realm of dreams or human feeling,
not on individuals or social groups, not toward the
attainment of theoretical knowledge of nature, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to become master over natural forces, to transform
them and adapt them toward an end.</p>

<p>Every mechanical invention arises from a need:
from the strict necessity for individual preservation
in the case of primitive man who wages war against
the powers of nature; from the desire for well-being
and the necessity for luxury in growing civilization;
from the need of creating little engines, imitating
instruments and machines, in the child. In a word,
<i>every particular invention, great or small, arises
from a particular need</i>; for, we repeat again, there
is no creative instinct in general. A man distinguished
for various inventions along practical lines,
writes: "As far as my memory allows, I can state
that in my case conception always results from a
material or mental need.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> It springs up suddenly.
Thus, in 1887, a speech of Bismarck made me so
angry that I immediately thought of arming my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
country with a repeating rifle. I had already made
various applications to the ministry of war, when
I learned that the Lebel system had just been
adopted. My patriotism was fully satisfied, but I
still have the design of the gun that I invented."
This communication mentions two or three other inventions
that arose under analogous circumstances,
but have had a chance of being adopted.</p>

<p>Among the requisite qualities I mention the natural
and necessary pre&euml;minence of certain groups of
sensations or images (visual, tactile, motor) that
may be decisive in determining the direction of the
inventor.</p>

<p>(II) Mechanical invention grows by successive
stratifications and additions, as in the sciences, but
more completely. It is a fine verification of the
"subsidiary law of growing complexity" previously
discussed.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> If we measure the distance traversed
since the distant ages when man was naked and
unarmed before nature to the present time of the
reign of machinery, we are astonished at the amount
of imagination produced and expended, often uselessly
lavished, and we ask ourselves how such a
work could have been misunderstood or so lightly
appreciated. It does not pertain to our subject to
make even a summary table of this long development.
The reader can consult the special works
which, unfortunately, are most often fragmentary
and lack a general view. So we should feel grateful
to a historian of the useful arts, L. Bourdeau, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
having attempted to separate out the philosophy of
the subject, and for having fastened it down in the
following formulas:<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>(a) The exploitation of the powers of nature is
made according to their degree of power.</p>

<p>(b) The extension of working instruments has
followed a logical evolution in the direction of growing
complexity and perfection.</p>

<p>Man, according to the observations of M. Bourdeau,
has applied his creative activity to natural
forces and has set them to work according to a regular
order, viz.:</p>

<p>(1) Human forces, the only ones available during
the "state of nature" and the savage state. Before
all else, man created weapons: the most circumscribed
primitive races have invented engines
for attack and defense&mdash;of wood, bone, stone, as
they were able. Then the weapon became a tool
by special adaptation:&mdash;the battle-club serves as a
lever, the tomahawk as a hammer, the flint ax as a
hatchet, etc. In this manner there is gradually
formed an arsenal of instruments. "Inferior to
most animals as regards certain work that would
have to be done with the aid of our organic resources
alone, we are superior to all as soon as we set our
tools at work. If the rodents with their sharp teeth
cut wood better than we can, we do it still better
with the ax, the chisel, the saw. Some birds, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the help of a strong beak, by repeated blows, penetrate
the trunk of a tree: but the auger, the gimlet,
the wimble do the same work better and more
quickly. The knife is superior to the carnivore's
teeth for tearing meat; the hoe better than the mole's
paw for digging earth, the trowel than the beaver's
tail for beating and spreading mortar. The oar permits
us to rival the fish's fin; the sail, the wing of
the bird. The distaff and spindle allow our imitating
the industry of insect spinners; etc. Man
thus reproduces and sums up in his technical contrivances
the scattered perfections of the animal
world. He even succeeds in surpassing them, because,
in the form of tools, he uses substances and
combinations of effects that cannot figure as part of
an organism."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> It is scarcely likely that most of
these inventions arose from a voluntary imitation of
animals: but even supposing such an origin, there
would still remain a fine place for personal creative
work. Man has produced by conscious effort what
life realizes by methods that escape us; so that the
creative imagination in man is a <i>succedaneum</i> of the
generative powers of nature.</p>

<p>(2) During the pastoral stage man brought animals
under subjection and discipline. An animal
is a machine, ready-made, that needs only to be
trained to obedience; but this training has required
and stimulated all sorts of inventions, from the harness
with which to equip it, to the chariots, wagons,
and roads with which and on which it moves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Later, the natural motors&mdash;air and water&mdash;have
furnished new material for human ingenuity,
e.g., in navigation; wind- and water-mills, used at
first to grind grain, then for a multitude of uses&mdash;sawing,
milling, lifting hammers; etc.</p>

<p>(4) Lastly, much later, come products of an already
mature civilization, artificial motors, explosives,&mdash;powder
and all its derivatives and substitutes&mdash;steam,
which has made such great
progress.</p>

<p>If the reader please to represent to himself well
the immense number of facts that we have just indicated
in a few lines; if he please to note that
every invention, great or small, before becoming a
fixed and realized thing, was at first an imagination,
a mere contrivance of the brain, an assembly of new
combinations or new relations, he will be forced to
admit that nowhere&mdash;not excepting even esthetic
production&mdash;has man imagined to such a great extent.</p>

<p>One of the reasons&mdash;though not the only one&mdash;that
supports the contrary opinion is, that by the
very law of their growing complexity, inventions
are grafted one on another. In all the useful arts
improvements have been so slow, and so gradually
wrought, that each one of them passed unperceived,
without leaving its author the credit for its discovery.
The immense majority of inventions are
anonymous&mdash;some great names alone survive. But,
whether individual or collective, imagination remains
imagination. In order that the plow, at first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
a simple piece of wood hardened by the fire and
pushed along with the human hand, should become
what it is to-day, through a long series of modifications
described in the special works, who knows
how many imaginations have labored! In the same
way, the uncertain flame of a resinous branch guiding
vaguely in the night leads us, through a long
series of inventions, to gas and electric lighting.
All objects, even the most ordinary and most common
that now serve us in our everyday-life, are <i>condensed
imagination</i>.</p>

<p>(III) More than any other form, mechanical
imagination depends strictly on physical conditions.
It cannot rest content with combining images, it
postulates material factors that impose themselves
unyieldingly. Compared to it, the scientific imagination
has much more freedom in the building of
its hypotheses. In general, every great invention
has been preceded by a period of abortive attempts.
History shows that the so-called "initial moment"
of a mechanical discovery, followed by its improvements,
is the moment ending a series of unsuccessful
trials: we thus skip a phase of pure imagination,
of imaginative construction that has not been able
to enter into the mold of an appropriate determinism.
There must have existed innumerable inventions
that we might term mechanical romances,
which, however, we cannot refer to because they
have left us no trace, not being born viable. Others
are known as curiosities because they have
blazed the path. We know that Otto de Guericke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
made four fruitless attempts before discovering his
air-pump. The brothers Montgolfier were possessed
with the desire to make "imitation clouds," like
those they saw moving over the Alps. "In order
to imitate nature," they at first enclosed water-vapor
in a light, stout case, which fell on cooling.
Then they tried hydrogen; then the production of a
gas with electrical properties; and so on. Thus,
after a succession of hypotheses and failures, they
finally succeeded. From the end of the sixteenth
century there was offered the possibility of communicating
at a distance by means of electricity.
"In a work published in 1624 the Jesuit, Father
Leurechon, described an imaginary apparatus (by
means of which, he said, people could converse at a
distance) for the aid of lovers who, by the connection
of their movements, would cause a needle to
move about a dial on which would be written the
letters of the alphabet; and the drawing accompanying
the text is almost a picture of Breguet's telegraph."
But the author considered it impossible
"in the absence of lovers having such ability."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Mechanical inventions that fail correspond to
erroneous or unverified scientific hypotheses. They
do not emerge from the stage of pure imagination,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
but they are instructive to the psychologist because
they give in bare form the initial work of the constructive
imagination in the technical field.</p>

<p>There still remain the requirements of reasoning,
of calculation, of adaptation to the properties of
matter. But, we repeat, this determinism has several
possible forms&mdash;one can reach the same goal
through different means. Besides, these determining
conditions are not lacking in any type of imagination;
there is only a difference as between lesser
and greater. Every imaginative construction from
the moment that it is little more than a group of
fancies, a spectral image haunting a dreamer's brain,
must take on a body, submit to external conditions
on which it depends, and which materialize it somewhat.
In this respect, architecture is an excellent
example. It is classed among the fine arts; but it
is subject to so many limitations that its process
of invention strongly resembles technical and mechanical
creations. Thus it has been possible to say
that "Architecture is the least personal of all the
arts." "Before being an art it is an industry in the
sense that it has nearly always a useful end that is
imposed on it and rules its manifestations. Whatever
it builds&mdash;a temple, a theater, a palace&mdash;it must
before all else subordinate its work to the end assigned
to it in advance. This is not all:&mdash;it must
take account of materials, climate, soil, location,
habits&mdash;of all things that may require much skill,
tact, calculation, which, however, do not interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
art as such, and do not permit architecture to manifest
its purely esthetic qualities."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Thus, at bottom, there is an identity of nature
between the constructive imagination of the mechanic
and that of the artist: the difference is only
in the end, the means, and the conditions. The
formula, <i>Ars homo additus naturae</i>, has been too
often restricted to esthetics&mdash;it should comprehend
everything artificial. Esthetes, doubtless, hold that
their imagination has for them a loftier quality&mdash;a
disputed question that psychology need not discuss;
for it, the essential mechanism is the same in
the two cases: a great mechanic is a poet in his own
way, because he makes instruments imitating life.
"Those constructions that at other times are the
marvel of the ignorant crowd deserve the admiration
of the reflecting:&mdash;Something of the power that
has organized matter seems to have passed into combinations
in which nature is imitated or surpassed.
Our machines, so varied in form and in function,
are the representatives of a new kingdom intermediate
between senseless and animate forms, having
the passivity of the former and the activity of the
latter, and exploiting everything for our sake. They
are counterfeits of animate beings, capable of giving
inert substances a regular functioning. Their
skeleton of iron, organs of steel, muscles of leather,
soul of fire, panting or smoking breath, rhythm of
movement&mdash;sometimes even the shrill or plaintive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
cries expressing effort or simulating pain:&mdash;all that
contributes to give them a fantastic likeness to life&mdash;a
specter and dream of inorganic life."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

to study language as an instrument of the practical life in its
relations to the creative imagination, especially the function of
analogy, in the extension and transformation of the meanings
of words. Works on linguistics are full of evidence on this
point. One could do better still by attending exclusively to the
vernacular, to slang, which shows us creative force in action.
"Slang," says one philologist, "has the property of figuring,
expressing, and picturing language.... With it, however
low its origin, one could reconstruct a people or a society."
Its principal, not only, means, are metaphor and allegory. It
lends itself equally to methods that degrade or ennoble existing
words, but with a very marked preference for the worse or
degrading meanings.</p></div>

seven years old I saw a locomotive, its fire and smoke. My
father's stove also made fire and smoke, but lacked wheels. If,
then, I told my father, we put wheels under the stove, it would
move like a locomotive. Later, when about thirteen, the sight of
a steam threshing-machine suggested to me the idea of making
a horseless wagon. I began a childish construction of one,
which my father made me give up," etc. The tendency toward
mechanical invention shows itself very early in some children&mdash;we
gave examples of it before. Our inventor adds: "My
imagination was strongest at about the age of 25 to 35 (I am
now 45 years old). After that time it seems to me that the
remainder of life is good only for producing less important
conceptions, forming a natural consequence of the principal conceptions
born of the period of youth."</p></div>

1787), Reiser, a German (1794), Salva (Madrid, 1796). The
insufficient study of dynamic electricity did not permit them
to succeed.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE COMMERCIAL IMAGINATION</h3>


<p>Taking the word "commercial" in its broadest
signification, I understand by this expression all
those forms of the constructive imagination that
have for their chief aim the production and distribution
of wealth, all inventions making for individual
or collective enrichment. Even less studied
than the form preceding, this imaginative manifestation
reveals as much ingenuity as any other. The
human mind is largely busied in that way. There
are inventors of all kinds&mdash;the great among these
equal those whom general opinion ranks as highest.
Here, as elsewhere, the great body invent nothing,
live according to tradition, in routine and imitation.</p>

<p>Invention in the commercial or financial field is
subject to various conditions with which we are not
concerned:</p>

<p>(1) External conditions:&mdash;Geographical, political,
economic, social, etc., varying according to
time, place, and people. Such is its external determinism&mdash;human
and social here in place of cosmic,
physical, as in mechanical invention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Internal, psychological conditions, most of
which are foreign to the primary and essential inventive
act:&mdash;on one hand, foresight, calculation,
strength of reasoning;&mdash;in a word, capacity for reflection;
on the other hand, assurance, recklessness,
soaring into the unknown&mdash;in a word, strong capacity
for action. Whence arise, if we leave out the
mixed forms, two principal types&mdash;the calculating,
the venturesome. In the former the rational element
is first. They are cautious, calculating, selfish
exploiters, with no great moral or social preoccupations.
In the latter, the active and emotional element
predominates. They have a broader sweep.
Of this sort were the merchant-sailors of Tyre,
Carthage, and Greece; the merchant-travelers of the
Middle Ages, the mercantile and gain-hungry explorers
of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
centuries; later, in a changed form, the organizers of
great companies, the inventors of monopolies,
American "trusts," etc. These are the great imaginative
minds.</p>

<p>Eliminating, then, from our subject, what is not
the purely imaginative element in order to study
it alone, I see only two points for us to treat, if we
would avoid repetition&mdash;at the initial moment of invention,
the intuitive act that is its germ; during
the period of development and organization, the
necessary and exclusive r&ocirc;le of schematic images.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>By "intuition" we generally understand a practical,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>immediate judgment that goes straight to the
goal. Tact, wisdom, scent, divination, are synonymous
or equivalent expressions. First let us note
that intuition does not belong exclusively to this
part of our subject, for it is found <i>in parvo</i> throughout;
but in commercial invention it is preponderating
on account of the necessity of perceiving quickly
and surely, and of grasping chances. "Genius for
business," someone has said, "consists in making
exact hypotheses regarding the fluctuations of
values." To characterize the mental state is easy,
if it is a matter merely of giving examples; very
difficult, if one attempts to discover its mechanism.</p>

<p>The physician who in a trice diagnoses a disease,
who, on a higher level, groups symptoms in order
to deduce a new disease from them, like Duchenne
de Boulogne; the politician who knows human nature,
the merchant who scents a good venture, etc.,
furnish examples of intuition. It does not depend
on the degree of culture;&mdash;not to mention women,
whose insight into practical matters is well known,
there are ignorant people&mdash;peasants, even savages&mdash;who,
in their limited sphere, are the equals of fine
diplomats.</p>

<p>But all these facts teach us nothing concerning its
psychological nature. Intuition presupposes acquired
experience of a special nature that gives the
judgment its validity and turns it in a particular
direction. Nevertheless, this accumulated knowledge
of itself gives no evidence as to the future.
Now, every intuition is an anticipation of the future,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
resulting from only two processes:&mdash;inductive or deductive
reasoning, e.g., the chemist foreseeing a
reaction; imagination, i.e., a representative construction.
Which is the chief process here? Evidently
the former, because it is not a matter of fancied
hypothesis, but of adaptation of former experience
to a new case. Intuition resembles logical
operations much more than it does imaginative combinations.
We may liken it to unconscious reasoning,
if we are not afraid of the seeming contradiction
of this expression which supposes a logical
operation without consciousness of the middle term.
Although questionable, it is perhaps to be preferred
to other proposed explanations&mdash;such as automatism,
habit, "instinct," "nervous connections." Carpenter,
who as promoter of "unconscious cerebration,"
deserves to be consulted, likens this state to
reflection. In ending, he reprints a letter that
John Stuart Mill wrote to him on the subject, in
which he says in substance that this capacity is found
in persons who have experience and lean toward
practical things, but attach little importance to
theory.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Every intuition, then, becomes concrete as a judgment,
equivalent to a conclusion. But what seems
obscure and even mysterious in it is the fact that,
from among many possible solutions, it finds at the
first shot the proper one. In my opinion this difficulty
arises largely from a partial comprehension
of the problem. By "intuition" people mean only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
cases in which the divination is correct; they forget
the other, far more numerous, cases that are failures.
The act by which one reaches a conclusion is a special
case of it. What constitutes the originality of
the operation is not its accuracy, but its <i>rapidity</i>&mdash;the
latter is the essential character, the former accessory.</p>

<p>Further, it must be acknowledged that the gift of
seeing correctly is an inborn quality, vouchsafed to
one, denied to another:&mdash;people are born with it,
just as they are born right-or left-handed: experience
does not give it&mdash;only permits it to be put to
use. As for knowing why the intuitive act now succeeds
and at another time fails, that is a question
that comes down to the natural distinction between
accurate and erroneous minds, which we do not need
to examine here.</p>

<p>Without dwelling longer on this initial stage, let
us return to the commercial imagination, and follow
it in its development.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The human race passed through a pre-commercial
age. The Australians, Fuegians, and their class
seem to have had no idea whatever of exchange.
This primitive period, which was long, corresponds
to the age of the horde or large clan. Commercial
invention, arising like the other forms from needs,&mdash;simple
and indispensable at first, artificial and superfluous
later,&mdash;could not arise in that dim period
when the groups had almost their sole relations with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
one another as war. Nothing called it to arise. But
at a higher stage the rudimentary form of commerce,
exchange in kind or truck, appeared early
and almost everywhere. Then this long, cumbersome,
inconvenient method gave place to a more
ingenious invention&mdash;the employment of "standard
values," beings or material objects serving as a
common measure for all the rest:&mdash;their choice varied
with the time, place, and people&mdash;e.g., certain
shells, salt, cocoa-seeds, cloth, straw-matting, cattle,
slaves, etc.; but this innovation held all the remainder
in the germ, for it was the first attempt at substitution.
But during the earliest period of commercial
evolution the chief effort at invention consisted
of finding increasingly more simple methods
in the mechanism of exchange. Thus, there succeeded
to these disparate values, the precious metals,
in the form of powder and ingots, subject to theft
and the inconveniences of weighing. Then, money
of fixed denomination, struck under the authority of
a chief or of a social group. Finally, gold and silver
are replaced by the letter of credit, the bank check,
and the numerous forms of fiduciary money.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>
<p>Every one of these forward steps is due to inventors.
I say inventors, in the plural, because it
is proven that every change in the means of exchange
has been imagined several times, in several
ages&mdash;though in the same way&mdash;on the surface of
our earth.</p>

<p>Summing up&mdash;the inventive labor of this period
is reduced to creating increasingly more simple and
more rapid methods of <i>substitution</i> in the commercial
mechanism.</p>

<p>The appearance of commerce on a large scale has
depended on the state of agriculture, industry, ways
of communication, social and economic conditions
and political extension. It came into being toward
the end of the Roman Republic. After the interruption
of the Middle Ages the activity is taken up
again by the Italian cities, the Hanseatic League,
etc.; in the fifteenth century with the great maritime
discoveries; in the sixteenth century by the <i>Conquistadores</i>,
hungering for adventure and wealth;
later on, by the mixed expeditions, whose expenses
are defrayed by merchants in common, and which
are often accompanied by armed bands that fight
for them; lastly comes the incorporation of great
companies that have been wittily dubbed "<i>Conquistadores</i>
of the counting-house."</p>

<p>We now come to the moment when commercial
invention attains its complex form and must move
great masses. Taken as a whole, its psychological
mechanism is the same as that of any other creative
work. In the first instance, the idea arises, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
inspiration, from reflection, or by chance. Then
comes a period of fermenting during which the inventor
sketches his construction in images, represents
to himself the material to be worked upon, the
grouping of stockholders, the making up of a capital,
the mechanism of buying and selling, etc. All
this differs from the genesis of an esthetic or mechanical
work only in the end, or in the nature of the
images. In the second phase it is necessary to proceed
to execution&mdash;a castle in the air must be made
a solid structure. Then appear a thousand obstructions
in the details that must be overcome. As
everywhere else, minor inventions become grafted
on the principal invention; the author lets us see the
poverty or richness in resource of his mind. Finally,
the work is triumphant, fails, or is only half-successful.</p>

<p>Did it keep only to these general traits, commercial
imagination would be merely the reiteration,
with slight changes, of forms already studied; but
it has characteristics all its own that must be distinguished.</p>

<p>(1) It is a combining or tactical imagination.
Heretofore, we have met nothing like it. This special
mark is derived from the very nature of its
determinism, which is very different from that limiting
the scientific or mechanical imagination. Every
commercial project, in order to emerge from the internal,
purely imaginative phase, and become a
reality, requires "coming to a head," very exact
calculation of frequently numerous, divergent, even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
contrary elements. The American dealer speculating
in grain is under the absolute necessity of being
quickly and surely informed regarding the agricultural
situation in all countries of the world that
are rich in grain, that export or import; in regard
to the probable chances of rain or drouth; the tariff
duties of the various countries, etc. Lacking that,
he buys and sells haphazard. Moreover, as he deals
in enormous quantities, the least error means great
losses, the smallest profit on a unit is of account,
and is multiplied and increased into a noticeable
gain.</p>

<p>Besides that initial intuition that shows opportune
business and moments, commercial imagination presupposes
a well-studied, detailed campaign for attack
and defense, a rapid and reliable glance at
every moment of execution in order to incessantly
modify this plan&mdash;it is a kind of war. All this
totality of special conditions results from a general
condition,&mdash;namely, competition, strife. We shall
come back to this point at the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>Let us follow to the end the working of this
creative imagination. Like the other forms, this
kind of invention arises from a need, a desire&mdash;that
of the spreading of "self-feeling," of the expansion
of the individual under the form of enrichment.
But this tendency, and with it the resulting imaginative
creation, can undergo changes.</p>

<p>It is a well-known law of the emotional life that
what is at first sought as a means may become an
end and be desired for itself. A very sensual passion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>may at length undergo a sort of idealization;
people study a science at first because it is useful, and
later because of its fascination; and we may desire
money in order to spend it, and later in order to
hoard it. Here it is the same: the financial inventor
is often possessed with a kind of intoxication&mdash;he
no longer labors for lucre, but for art; he becomes,
in his own way, an author of romance. His imagination,
set at the beginning toward gain, now seeks
only its complete expansion, the assertion and eruption
of its creative power, the pleasure of inventing
for invention's sake,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> daring the extraordinary,
the unheard-of&mdash;it is the victory of pure construction.
The natural equilibrium between the three
necessary elements of creation&mdash;mobility, combination
of images, calculation&mdash;is destroyed. The rational
element gives way, is obliterated, and the
speculator is launched into adventure with the possibility
of a dazzling success or astounding catastrophe.
But let us note well that the primary and sole
cause of this change is in the affective and motor
element, in an hypertrophy of the lust for power, in
an unmeasured and morbid want of expansion of
self. Here, as everywhere, the source of invention
is the emotional nature of the inventor.</p>

<p>(2) A second special character of commercial
imagination is the exclusive employment of schematic
representations. Although this process is also
met with in the sciences and especially in social<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
inventions, the imaginative type that we are now
considering has the privilege of using them without
exception. This, then, is the proper moment
for a description.</p>

<p>By "schematic images" I mean those that are, by
their very nature, intermediate between the concrete
image and the pure concept, but approach more
nearly the concept. We have already pointed out
very different kinds of representations&mdash;concrete
images, material pertaining to plastic and mechanical
imagination; the emotional abstractions of the diffluent
imagination; affective images, the type of
which is found in musicians; symbolic images, familiar
in mystics. It may seem improper to add
another class to this list, but it is not a meaningless
subtlety. Indeed, there are no images in general
that, according to the ordinary conception, would
be copies of reality. Even their separation into
visual, auditory, motor, etc., is not sufficient, because
it distinguishes them only with regard to their
<i>origin</i>. There are other differences. We have seen
that the image, like everything living, undergoes
corrosions, damages, twisting, and transformation:
whence it comes about that this remainder of former
impressions varies according to its composition, i.e.,
in simplicity, complexity, grouping of its constitutive
elements, etc., and takes on many aspects. On
the other hand, as the difference between the chief
types of creative imagination depends in part on the
materials employed&mdash;on the nature of the images
that serve in mental building&mdash;a precise determination
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>of the nature of the images belonging to each
type is not an idle operation.</p>

<p>In order to clearly explain what we mean by
schematic images, let us represent by a line, <i>PC</i>, the
scale of images according to the degree of complexity,
from the percept, <i>P</i>, to the concept, <i>C</i>.</p>

<p class='center'>
P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;X&mdash;&mdash;G&mdash;&mdash;S&mdash;&mdash;C<br />
</p>

<p>As far as I am aware, this determination of all
the degrees has never been made. The work would
be delicate; I do not regard it as impossible. I
have no intention to undertake it, even as I do not
pretend that I have given above the complete list
of the various forms of images.</p>

<p>If, then, we consider the foregoing figure merely
as a means of representing the gradation to the eye,
the image in moving, by hypothesis, from the moment
of perception, <i>P</i>, is less and less in contact
with reality, becomes simplified, impoverished, and
loses some of its constitutive elements. At <i>X</i> it
crosses the middle threshold to approach nearer and
nearer to the concept. At <i>G</i> let us locate generic
images, primitive forms of generalization, whose
nature and process of becoming are well-known;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
we should place farther along, at <i>S</i>, schematic
images, which require a higher function of mind.
Indeed, the generic image results from a spontaneous
fusion of like or very analogous images&mdash;such
as the vague representation of the oak, the horse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the negro, etc.; it belongs to only one class of objects.
The schematic image results from a voluntary
act; it is not limited to exact resemblances&mdash;it
rises into abstraction; so it is scarcely accompanied
by a fleeting representation of concrete objects&mdash;it
is almost reduced to the word. At a higher level,
it is freed from all sensuous elements or pictures,
and is reduced, in the present instance, to the mere
notion of value&mdash;it is not different from a pure concept.
While the artist and the mechanic build with
concrete images, the commercial imagination can
act directly neither on things nor on their immediate
representations, because from the time that it
goes beyond the primitive age it requires a substitution
of increasing generality; materials become
values that are in turn reducible to symbols. Consequently,
it proceeds as in the stating and solving
of abstract problems in which, after having substituted
for things and their relations figures and
letters, calculation works with signs, and indirectly
with things.</p>

<p>Aside from the first moment of invention, the
finding of the idea&mdash;an invariable psychological
state&mdash;it must be recognized that in its development
and detailed construction the commercial imagination
is made up chiefly of calculations and combinations
that hardly permit concrete images. If we
admit, then,&mdash;and this is unquestionable&mdash;that these
are the materials <i>par excellence</i> of the creative imagination,
we shall be disposed to hold that the imaginative
type we are now studying is a kind of involution,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>a case of impoverishment&mdash;an unacceptable
thesis as regards the invention itself, but strictly
acceptable as regards the conditions that necessity
imposes upon it.</p>

<p>In closing, let us note that financial imagination
does not always have as its goal the enriching of an
individual or of a closely limited group of associates:
it can aim higher, act on greater masses, address
itself strenuously to a problem as complex as
the reformation of the finances of a powerful state.
All the civilized nations count in their history men
who imagined a financial system and succeeded,
with various fortunes, in making it prevail. The
word "system," consecrated by usage, makes unnecessary
any comment, and relates this form of
imagination to that of scientists and philosophers.
Every system rests on a master-conception, on an
ideal, a center about which there is assembled the
mental construction made up of imagination and
calculation which, if circumstances permit, must
take shape, must show that it can live.</p>

<p>Let us call to mind the author of the first, or at
least, of the most notorious of these "systems."
Law claimed that he was applying "the methods of
philosophy, the principles of Descartes, to social
economy, abandoned hitherto to chance and empiricism."
His ideal was the institution of <i>credit</i>
by the state. Commerce, said he, was during its
first stage the exchange of merchandise in kind;
in a second stage, exchange by means of another,
more manageable, commodity or universal value, security
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>equivalent to the object it represented; it
must enter a third stage when exchange will be
made by a purely conventional sign having no value
of its own. Paper represents money, just as the
latter represents goods, "with the difference that
the paper is not security, but a simple promise, constituting
credit." The state must do systematically
what individuals have done instinctively; but it
must also do what individuals cannot do&mdash;create
currency by printing on the paper of exchange the
seal of public authority. We know the history of
the downfall of this system, the eulogies and criticisms
it has received:&mdash;but because of the originality
and boldness of his views, the inexhaustible fecundity
of his lesser inventions, Law holds an undisputed
place among the great imaginative minds.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>We said above that commerce, in its higher manifestations,
is a kind of war.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Here, then, would
be the place to study the military imagination. The
subject cannot be treated save by a man of the profession,
so I shall limit myself to a few brief remarks
based on personal information, or gleaned
from authorities.</p>

<p>Between the various types of imagination hitherto
studied we have shown great differences as regards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
their external conditions. While the so-called forms
of pure imagination, whence esthetic, mythic, religious,
mystic creations arise, can realize themselves
by submitting to material conditions that are simple
and not very exacting, the others can become embodied
only when they satisfy an <i>ensemble</i> of numerous,
inevitable, rigorously determined conditions;
the goal is fixed, the materials are rigid, there is
little choice of the appropriate means. If there be
added to the inflexible laws of nature unforeseen
human passions and determinations, as in political
or social invention, or the offensive combination of
opponents, as in commerce and war; then the imaginative
construction is confronted with problems of
constantly growing complexity. The most ingenious
inventor cannot invent an object as a whole,
letting his work develop through an immanent
logic:&mdash;the early plan must be continually modified
and readapted; and the difficulty arises not merely
from the multiple elements of the problem to be
solved, but from ceaseless changes in their positions.
So one can advance only step by step, and go forward
by calculations and strict examination of possibilities.
Hence it results that underneath this
thick covering of material and intellectual conditions
(calculation, reasoning), spontaneity (the aptness
for finding new combinations, "that art of inventing
without which we hardly advance"<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>) reveals
itself to few clear-sighted persons; but, in spite
of everything, this creative power is everywhere,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
flowing like subterranean streams, a vivifying
agency.</p>

<p>These general remarks, although not applicable
exclusively to the military imagination, find their
justification in it, because of its extreme complexity.
Let us rapidly enumerate, proceeding from without
inwards, the enormous mass of representations that
it has to move and combine in order to make its
construction adequate to reality, able at a precise
moment to cease being a dream:&mdash;(1) Arms, engines,
instruments of destruction and supply, varying
according to time, place, richness of the country,
etc. (2) The equally variable human element&mdash;mercenaries,
a national army; strong, tried troops
or weak and new. (3) The general principles of
war, acquired by the study of the masters. (4) More
personal is the power of reflection, the habitual
solving of tactical and strategic problems. "Battles,"
said Napoleon, "are thought out at length, and in
order to be successful it is necessary that we think
several times in regard to what may happen." All
the foregoing should be headed "science." Advancing
more and more within the secret psychology
of the individual, we come to art, the characteristic
work of pure imagination. (5) Let us note the
exact, rapid intuition at the commencement of the
opportune moments. (6) Lastly, the creative element,
the conception, a natural gift bearing the hall-mark
of each inventor. Thus "the Napoleonic esthetics
was always derived from a single concept,
based on a principle that may be summed up thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>&mdash;Strict
economy wherever it can be done; expenditure
without limit on the decisive point. This principle
inspires the strategy of the master; it directs
everything, especially his battle-tactics, in which it
is synthetized and summed up."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Such, in analytical terms, appears the hidden
spring that makes everything move, and it is to be
attributed neither to experience nor to reasoning,
nor to wise combinations, for it arises from the innermost
depths of the inventor. "The principle
exists in him in a latent state, i.e., in the depths of
the unconscious, and unconsciously it is that he
applies it, when the shock of the circumstances, of
goal and means, causes to flash from his brain the
spark stimulating the artistic solution <i>par excellence</i>,
one that reaches the limits of human perfection."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE UTOPIAN IMAGINATION<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></h3>


<p>When the human mind creates, it can use only
two classes of ideas as materials to embody its idea,
viz.:</p>

<p>(1) Natural phenomena, the forces of the organic
and inorganic worlds. In its scientific form,
seeking to explain, to know, it ends in the hypothesis,
a disinterested creation. In its industrial aspect,
aiming towards application and utilization, it ends
in practical, interested inventions.</p>

<p>(2) Human, i.e., psychic elements&mdash;instincts,
passions, feelings, ideas, and actions. Esthetic creation
is the disinterested form, social invention is the
utilitarian form.</p>

<p>Consequently, we may say that invention in
science resembles invention in the fine arts, both
being speculative; and that mechanical and industrial
invention approaches social invention through
a common tendency toward the practical. I shall
not insist on this distinction, which, to be definite,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
rests only on partial characters; I merely wish to
mention that invention, whose r&ocirc;le in social, political
and moral evolution is large, must, in order
to be a success, adopt certain processes while neglecting
others. This the Utopians do not do.</p>

<p>The development of human societies depends on
a multitude of factors, such as race, geographic and
economic conditions, war, etc., which we need
neither enumerate nor study. One only belongs to
our topic&mdash;the successive appearance of idealistic
conceptions that, like all other creations of mind,
tend to realize themselves, the moral ideal consisting
of new combinations arising from the predominance
of one feeling, or from an unconscious elaboration
(inspiration), or from analogy.</p>

<p>At the beginning of civilizations we meet semi-historic,
semi-legendary persons&mdash;Manu, Zoroaster,
Moses, Confucius, etc., who were inventors or reformers
in the social and moral spheres. That a
part of the inventions attributed to them must be
credited to predecessors or successors is probable;
but the invention, no matter who is its author, remains
none the less invention. We have said elsewhere,
and may repeat, that the expression <i>inventor</i>
in morals may seem strange to some, because we are
imbued with the notion of a knowledge of good and
evil that is innate, universal, bestowed on all men
and in all times. If we admit, on the other hand,
as observation compels us to do, not a ready-made
morality, but a morality in the making, it must be,
indeed, the <i>creation</i> of an individual or of a group.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Everybody recognizes inventors in geometry, in
music, in the plastic and mechanic arts; but there
have also been men who, in their moral dispositions,
were very superior to their contemporaries, and
were promoters, initiators.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> For reasons of which
we are ignorant, analogous to those that produce a
great poet or a great painter, there arise moral
geniuses who feel strongly what others do not feel
at all, just as does a great poet, in comparison with
the crowd. But it is not enough that they feel: they
must create, they must realize their ideal in a belief
and in rules of conduct accepted by other men. All
the founders of great religions were inventors of
this kind. Whether the invention comes from
themselves alone, or from a collectivity of which
they are the sum and incarnation, matters little. In
them moral invention has found its complete form;
like all invention, it is organic. The legend relates
that Buddha, possessed with the desire of finding
the perfect road of salvation for himself and all other
men, gives himself up, at first, to an extravagant
asceticism. He perceives the uselessness of this
and renounces it. For seven years he meditates,
then he beholds the light. He comes into possession
of knowledge of the means that give freedom
from <i>Karma</i> (the chain of causes and effects), and
from the necessity of being born again. Soon he
renounces the life of contemplation, and during fifty
years of ceaseless wanderings preaches, makes converts,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>organizes his followers. Whether true or
false historically, this tale is psychologically exact.
A fixed and besetting idea, trial followed by failure,
the decisive moment of <i>Eureka!</i> then the inner revelation
manifests itself outwardly, and through the
labors of the master and his disciples becomes complete,
imposes itself on millions of men. In what
respect does this mode of creation differ from others,
at least in the practical order?</p>

<p>Thus, from the viewpoint of our present study,
we may divide ethics into living and dead. Living
ethics arise from needs and desires, stimulate an
imaginative construction that becomes fixed in actions,
habits and laws; they offer to men a concrete,
positive ideal which, under various and often contrary
aspects, is always happiness. The lifeless
ethics, from which invention has withdrawn, arise
from reflection upon, and the rational codification of,
living ethics. Stored away in the writings of philosophers,
they remain theoretical, speculative, without
appreciable influence on the masses, mere material
for dissertation and commentary.</p>

<p>In proportion as we recede from distant origins
the light grows, and invention in the social and
moral order becomes manifest as the work of two
principal categories of minds&mdash;the fantastic, the
positive. The former, purely imaginative beings,
visionaries, utopians, are closely related to poets and
artists. The latter, practical creators or reformers,
capable of organizing, belong to the family of inventors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>in the industrial-commercial-mechanical order.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>The chimerical form of imagination, applied to
the social sciences, is the one that, taking account
neither of the external determinism nor of practical
requirements, spreads out freely. Such are the creators
of ideal republics, seeking for a lost or to-be-discovered-in-the-future
golden age, constructing, as
their fancy pleases, human societies in their large
outlines and in their details. They are social novelists,
who bear the same relation to sociologists that
poets do to critics. Their dreams, subjected merely
to the conditions of an inner logic, have lived only
within themselves, an ideal life, without ever passing
through the test of application. It is the
creative imagination in its unconscious form, restrained
to its first phase.</p>

<p>Nothing is better known than their names and
their works: The <i>Republic</i> of Plato, Thomas More's
<i>Utopia</i>, Campanella's <i>City of the Sun</i>, Harrington's
<i>Oceana</i>, Fenelon's <i>Salente</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> However idealistic
they may be, one could easily show that all the
materials of their ideal are taken from the surrounding
reality, they bear the stamp of the <i>milieu</i>, be it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Greek, English, Christian, etc., in which they lived,
and it should not be forgotten that in the Utopians
everything is not chimerical&mdash;some have been revealers,
others have acted as stimuli or ferments.
True to its mission, which is to make innovations,
the constructive imagination is a spur that arouses;
it hinders social routine and prevents stagnation.</p>

<p>Among the creators of ideal societies there is one,
almost contemporary, who would deserve a study
of individual psychology&mdash;Ch. Fourier. If it is a
question merely of fertility in pure construction, I
doubt whether we could find one superior to him&mdash;he
is equal to the highest, with the special characteristic
of being at the same time exuberant to delirium
and exact in details to the least minuti&aelig;. He
is such a fine type of the imaginative intellect that he
deserves that we stop a moment.</p>

<p>His cosmogony seems the work of an omnipotent
demiurge fashioning the universe at will. His conception
of the future world with its "counter-cast"
creations, where the present ugliness and troubles
of animal reign become changed into their opposites,
where there will be "anti-lions," "anti-crocodiles,"
"anti-whales," etc., is one example of hundreds
showing his inexhaustible richness in fantastic visions:
the work of an imagination that is hot and
overflowing, with no rational preoccupation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, his psychogony, based on the
idea of metempsychosis borrowed from the Orient,
gives itself up to numerical vagaries. Assuming for
every soul a periodical rebirth, he assigns it first a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
period of "ascending subversion," the first phase
of which lasts five thousand years, the second thirty-six
thousand; then comes a period of completion,
9,000 years; and then a period of "descending subversion,"
whose first stage is 27,000 years, and the
second 4,000 years&mdash;a total of 81,000 years. This
form of imagination is already known to us.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The principal part of his psychology, the theory
of the emotions, questionable in many respects, is
relatively rational. But in the construction of human
society, the duality of his imagination&mdash;powerful
and minute&mdash;reappears. We know his methodical
organization: the <i>group</i>, composed of seven to
nine persons; the <i>series</i>, comprising twenty-four to
thirty-two groups; a <i>phalanx</i> that includes eighteen
groups, constituting the phalanstery; the small city,
a general center of phalanges; the provincial city,
the imperial capital, the universal metropolis. He
has a passion for classification and ordering; "his
phalanstery works like a clock."</p>

<p>This rare imaginative type well deserved a few
remarks, because of its mixture of apparent exactness
and a natural, unconscious utopianism and extravagance.
For, beneath all these pulsating inventions
of precise, petty details, the foundation is none
the less a purely speculative construction of the
mind. Let us add an incredible abuse of analogy,
that chief intellectual instrument of invention, of
which only the reading of his books can give an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
idea.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Heinrich Heine said of Michelet, "He has a
Hindoo imagination." The term would apply still
better to Fourier, in whom coexist unchecked profusion
of images and the taste for numerical accumulations.
People have tried to explain this abundance
of figures and calculation as a professional
habit&mdash;he was for a long time a bookkeeper or
cashier, always an excellent accountant. But this
is taking the effect for cause. This dualism existed
in the very nature of his mind, and he took advantage
of it in his calling. The study of the
numerical imagination<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> has shown how it is frequently
met with among orientals, whose imaginative
development is unquestioned, and we have seen
why the idealistic imagination agrees so well with
the indefinite series of numbers and makes use of it
as a vehicle.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>With practical inventors and reformers the ideal
falls&mdash;not that they sacrifice it for their personal
interests, but because they have a comprehension of
possibilities. The imaginative construction must be
corrected, narrowed, mutilated, if it is to enter into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the narrow frame of the conditions of existence, until
it becomes adapted and determined. This process
has been described several times, and it is needless
to repeat it here in other terms. Nevertheless, the
ideal&mdash;understanding by this term the unifying
principle that excites creative work and supports it
in its development&mdash;undergoes metamorphosis and
must be not only individual but collective; the creation
does not realize itself save through a "communion
of minds," by a co-operation of feelings and
of wills; the work of one conscious individual must
become the work of a social consciousness.</p>

<p>That form of imagination, creating and organizing
social groups, manifests itself in various degrees
according to the tendency and power of creators.</p>

<p>There are the founders of small societies, religious
in form&mdash;the Essenes, the earliest Christian
communities, the monastic orders of the Orient and
Occident, the great Catholic or Mohammedan congregations,
the semi-lay, semi-religious sects like
the Moravian Brotherhood, the Shakers, Mormons,
etc. Less complete because it does not cover the
individual altogether in all the acts of life is the
creation of secret associations, professional unions,
learned societies, etc. The founder conceives an
ideal of complete living or one limited to a given
end, and puts it into practice, having for material
men grouped of their free choice, or by co&ouml;ptation.</p>

<p>There is invention operating on great masses&mdash;social
or political invention strictly so called&mdash;ordinarily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>not proposed but imposed, which, however,
despite its coercive power, is subject to requirements
even more numerous than mechanical, industrial, or
commercial invention. It has to struggle against
natural forces, but most of all against human forces&mdash;inherited
habits, customs, traditions. It must
make terms with dominant passions and ideas, finding
its justification, like all other creation, only in
success.</p>

<p>Without entering into the details of this inevitable
determination, which would require useless repetition,
we may sum up the r&ocirc;le of the constructive
imagination in social matters by saying that it has
undergone a regression&mdash;i.e., that its area of development
has been little by little narrowed; not that
inventive genius, reduced to pure construction in
images, has suffered an eclipse, but on its part it
has had to make increasingly greater room for experiment,
rational elements, calculation, inductions
and deductions that permit foresight&mdash;for practical
necessities.</p>

<p>If we omit the spontaneous, instinctive, semi-conscious
invention of the earliest ages, that was
sufficient for primitive societies, and keep to creations
that were the result of reflection and of great
pretension, we can roughly distinguish three successive
periods:</p>

<p>(1) A very long idealistic phase (Antiquity, Renaissance)
when triumphed the pure imagination,
and the play of the free fancy that spends itself in
social novels. Between the creation of the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and the life of contemporary society there was no
relation; they were worlds apart, strangers to one
another. The true Utopians scarcely troubled themselves
to make applications. Plato and More&mdash;would
they have wished to realize their dreams?</p>

<p>(2) An intermediate phase, when an attempt is
made to pass from the ideal to the practical, from
pure speculation to social facts. Already, in the
eighteenth century, some philosophers (Locke,
Rousseau) drew up constitutions, at the request of
interested persons. During this period, when the
work of the imagination, instead of merely becoming
fixed in books, tends to become objectified in
acts, we find many failures and some successes. Let
us recall the fruitless attempts of the "phalansteries"
in France, in Algeria, Brazil, and in the
United States. Robert Owen was more fortunate;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
in four years he reformed New Larnak, after his
ideal, and with varying fortune founded short-lived
colonies. Saint-Simonism has not entirely died out;
the primitive civilization after his ideal rapidly disappeared,
but some of his theories have filtered into
or have become incorporated with other doctrines.</p>

<p>(3) A phase in which imaginative creation becomes
subordinated to practical life: The conception
of society ceases to be purely idealistic or constructed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span><i>a priori</i> by deduction from a single principle;
it recognizes the conditions of its environment,
adapts itself to the necessities of its development.
It is the passage from the absolutely autonomous
state of the imagination to a period when it submits
to the laws of a rational imperative. In other
words, the transition from the esthetic to the scientific,
and especially the practical, form. Socialism
is a well-known and excellent example of this.
Compare its former utopias, down to about the middle
of the last century, with its contemporary forms,
and without difficulty we can appreciate the amount
of imaginative elements lost in favor of an at least
equivalent quantity of rational elements and positive
calculations.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Foundations of the Creative Imagination</span></h3>

<p>Why is the human mind able to create? In a
certain sense this question may seem idle, childish,
and even worse. We might just as well ask why
does man have eyes and not an electric apparatus
like the torpedo? Why does he perceive directly
sounds but not the ultra-red and ultra-violet rays?
Why does he perceive changes of odors but not magnetic
changes? And so on <i>ad infinitum</i>. We will
put the question in a very different manner: Being
given the physical and mental constitution of man
such as it is at present, how is the creative imagination
a natural product of this constitution?</p>

<p>Man is able to create for two principal reasons.
The first, motor in nature, is found in the action
of his needs, appetites, tendencies, desires. The
second is the possibility of a spontaneous revival of
images that become grouped in new combination.</p>

<p>1. We have already shown in detail<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
hypothesis of a "creative instinct," if the expression
is used not as an abbreviated or metaphorical formula
but in the strict sense, is a pure chimera, an
empty entity. In studying the various types of imagination
we have always been careful to note that
every mode of creation may be reduced, as regards
its beginnings, to a tendency, a want, a special, determinate
desire. Let us recall for the last time these
initial conditions of all invention&mdash;these desires, conscious
or not, that excite it.</p>

<p>The wants, tendencies, desires&mdash;it matters not
which term we adopt&mdash;the whole of which constitutes
the instinct of individual preservation, have
been the generators of all inventions dealing with
food-getting, housing, making of weapons, instruments,
and machines.</p>

<p>The need for individual and social expansion or
extension has given rise to military, commercial,
and industrial invention, and in its disinterested
form, esthetic creation.</p>

<p>As for the sexual instinct, its psychic fertility is
in no way less than the physical&mdash;it is an inexhaustible
source of imagination in everyday life as well as
in art.</p>

<p>The wants of man in contact with his fellows
have engendered, through instinctive or reflective
action, the numerous social and practical creations
regulating human groups, and they are rough or
complex, stable or unstable, just or unjust, kindly
or harsh.</p>

<p>The need of knowing and of explaining, well or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
ill, has created myths, religions, philosophical systems,
scientific hypotheses.</p>

<p>Every want, tendency or desire may, then, become
creative, by itself or associated with others,
and into these final elements it is that analysis
must resolve "creative spontaneity." This vague expression
corresponds to a <i>sum</i>, not to a special property.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
Every invention, then, has a <i>motor</i> origin;
<i>the ultimate basis of the constructive imagination is
motor</i>.</p>

<p>2. But needs and desires by themselves cannot
create&mdash;they are only a stimulus and a spring.
Whence arises the need of a second condition&mdash;the
spontaneous revival of images.</p>

<p>In many animals that are endowed only with
memory the return of images is always provoked.
Sensation from without or from within bring them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
into consciousness under the form, pure and simple,
of former experience; whence we have reproduction,
repetition without new associations. People
of slight imagination and used to routine approach
this mental condition. But, as a matter of
fact, man from his second year on, and some higher
animals, go beyond this stage&mdash;they are capable of
spontaneous revival. By this term I mean that revival
that comes about abruptly, without <i>apparent</i>
antecedents. We know that these act in a latent
form, and consist of thinking by analogy, affective
dispositions, unconscious elaboration. This sudden
appearance excites other states which, grouped into
new associations, contain the first elements of the
creative act.</p>

<p>Taken altogether, and however numerous its
manifestations, the constructive imagination seems
to me reducible to three forms, which I shall call
<i>sketched</i>, <i>fixed</i>, <i>objectified</i>, according as it remains
an internal fancy, or takes on a material but contingent
and unstable form, or is subjected to the
conditions of a rigorous internal or external determinism.</p>

<p>(a) The <i>sketched</i> form is primordial, original,
the simplest of all; it is a nascent moment or first
attempt. It appears first of all in dreaming&mdash;an
embryonic, unstable and unco&ouml;rdinated manifestation
of the creative imagination&mdash;a transition-stage
between passive reproduction and organized construction.
A step higher is revery, whose flitting
images, associated by chance, without personal intervention,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>are nevertheless vivid enough to exclude
from consciousness every impression of the external
world&mdash;so much so that the day-dreamer re-enters
it only with a shock of surprise. More coherent are
the imaginary constructions known as "castles in
Spain"&mdash;the works of a wish considered unrealizable,
fancies of love, ambition, power and wealth,
the goal of which seems to be forever beyond our
reach. Lastly, still higher, come all the plans for
the future conceived vaguely and as barely possible&mdash;foreseeing
the end of a sickness, of a business
enterprise, of a political event, etc.</p>

<p>This vague and "outline" imagination, penetrating
our entire life, has its peculiar characters&mdash;the
unifying principle is <i>nil</i> or ephemeral, which fact always
reduces it to the dream as a type; it does not
externalize itself, does not change into acts, a consequence
of its basically chimerical nature or of
weakness of will, which reduces it to a strictly internal
and individual existence. It is needless to say
that this kind of imagination is a permanent and
definite form with the dreamers living in a world of
ceaselessly reappearing images, having no power to
organize them, to change them into a work of art,
a theory, or a useful invention.</p>

<p>The "sketched" form is or remains an elementary,
primitive, automatic form. Conformably to the general
law ruling the development of mind&mdash;passage
from indefinite to definite, from the incoherent to
the coherent, from spontaneity to reflection, from
the reflex to the voluntary period&mdash;the imagination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
comes out of its swaddling-clothes, is changed&mdash;through
the intervention of a teleological act that
assigns it an end; through the union of rational elements
that subdue it for an adaptation. Then appear
the other two forms.</p>

<p>(b) The <i>fixed</i> form comprises mythic and esthetic
creations, philosophical and scientific hypotheses.
While the "outline" imagination remains an internal
phenomenon, existing only in and for a single individual,
the fixed form is projected outwards, made
something else. The former has no reality other
than the momentary belief accompanying it; the latter
exists by itself, for its creator and for others;
the work is accepted, rejected, examined, criticised.
Fiction rests on the same level as reality. Do not
people discuss seriously the objective value of certain
myths, and of metaphysical theories? the action of a
novel or drama as though it were a matter of real
events? the character of the <i>dramatis personae</i> as
though they were living flesh and blood?</p>

<p>The fixed imagination moves in an elastic frame.
The material elements circumscribing it and composing
it have a certain fluidity; they are language,
writing, musical sounds, colors, forms, lines. Furthermore,
we know that its creations, in spite of the
spontaneous adherence of the mind accepting them,
are the work of a free will; they could have been
otherwise&mdash;they preserve an indelible imprint of
contingency and subjectivity.</p>

<p>(c) This last mark is rubbed out without disappearing
(for a thing imagined is always a personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
thing) in the objectified form that comprises successful
practical inventions&mdash;whether mechanical, industrial,
commercial, military, social, or political.
These have no longer an arbitrary, borrowed reality;
they have their place in the totality of physical
and social phenomena. They resemble creations of
nature, subject like them to fixed conditions of
existence and to a limited determinism. We shall
not dwell longer on this last character, so often
pointed out.</p>

<p>In order the better to comprehend the distinction
between the three forms of imagination let us
borrow for a moment the terminology of spiritualism
or of the common dualism&mdash;merely as a means
of explaining the matter clearly. The "outline"
imagination is a soul without a body, a pure
spirit, without determination in space. The "fixed"
imagination is a soul or spirit surrounded by an
almost immaterial sheath, like angels or demons,
genii, shadows, the "double" of savages, the <i>peresprit</i>
of spiritualists, etc. The <i>objectified</i> imagination
is soul and body, a complete organization after
the pattern of living people; the ideal is incarnated,
but it must undergo transformation, reductions and
adaptations, in order that it may become practical&mdash;just
as the soul, according to spiritualism, must bend
to the necessities of the body, to be at the same time
the servant of, and served by, the bodily organs.</p>

<p>According to general opinion the great imaginers
are found only in the first two classes, which is,
in the strict sense of the word, true; in the full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
sense of the word false. As long as it remains "outline,"
or even "fixed," the constructive imagination
can reign as supreme mistress. Objectified, it still
rules, but shares its power with competitors; it
avails nought without them, they can do nothing
without it. What deceives us is the fact that we see
it no longer in the open. Here the imaginative
stroke resembles those powerful streams of water
that must be imprisoned in a complicated network
of canals and ramifications varying in shape and
in diameter before bursting forth in multiple jets
and in liquid architecture.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Imaginative Type.</span></h3>

<p>Let us try now, by way of conclusion, to present
to the reader a picture of the whole of the imaginative
life in all its degrees.</p>

<p>If we consider the human mind principally under
its intellectual aspect&mdash;i.e., insofar as it knows and
thinks, deducting its emotions and voluntary activity&mdash;the
observation of individuals distinguishes
some very clear varieties of mentality.</p>

<p>First, those of a "positive" or realistic turn of
mind, living chiefly on the external world, on what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
is perceived and what is immediately deducible
therefrom&mdash;alien or inimical to vain fancy; some of
them flat, limited, of the earth earthy; others, men
of action, energetic but limited by real things.</p>

<p>Second, abstract minds, "quintessence abstractors,"
with whom the internal life is dominant in the form
of combinations of concepts. They have a schematic
representation of the world, reduced to a hierarchy
of general ideas, noted by symbols. Such are the
pure mathematicians, the pure metaphysicians. If
these two tendencies exist together, or, as happens,
are grafted one on the other, without anything to
counterbalance them, the abstract spirit attains its
perfect form.</p>

<p>Midway between these two groups are the imaginers
in whom the internal life predominates in the
form of combinations of images, which fact distinguishes
them clearly from the abstractors. The
former alone interest us, and we shall try to trace
this imaginative type in its development from the
normal or average stage to the moment when ever-growing
exuberance leads us into pathology.</p>

<p>The explanation of the various phases of this development
is reducible to a well-known psychologic
law&mdash;the natural antagonism between sensation and
image, between phenomena of peripheral origin and
phenomena of central origin; or, in a more general
form, between the outer and inner life. I shall not
dwell long on this point, which Taine has so admirably
treated.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> He has shown in detail how the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
image is a spontaneously arising sensation, one that
is, however, aborted by the opposing shock of real
sensation, which is its reducer, producing on it an
arresting action and maintaining it in the condition
of an internal, subjective fact. Thus, during the
waking hours, the frequency and intensity of impressions
from without press the images back to the
second level; but during sleep, when the external
world is as it were suppressed, their hallucinatory
tendency is no longer kept in check, and the world
of dreams is momentarily the reality.</p>

<p>The psychology of the imaginer reduces itself to
a progressively increasing interchange of r&ocirc;les.
Images become stronger and stronger states; perceptions,
more and more feeble. In this movement
opposite to nature I note four steps, each of which
corresponds to particular conditions: (1) The quantity
of images; (2) quantity and intensity; (3)
quantity, intensity and duration; (4) complete systematization.</p>

<p>(1) In the first place the predominance of imagination
is marked only by the quantity of representations
invading consciousness; they teem, break
apart, become associated, combine easily and in various
ways. All the imaginative persons who have
given us their experiences either orally or in writing
agree in regard to the extreme ease of the formation
of associations, not in repeating past expedience,
but in sketching little romances.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> From
among many examples I choose one. One of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
correspondents writes that if at church, theatre, on
a street, or in a railway station, his attention is attracted
to a person&mdash;man or woman&mdash;he immediately
makes up, from the appearance, carriage and attractiveness
his or her present or past, manner of
life, occupation&mdash;representing to himself the part of
the city he or she must dwell in, the apartments,
furniture, etc.&mdash;a construction most often erroneous;
I have many proofs of it. Surely this disposition
is normal; it departs from the average only by an
excess of imagination that is replaced in others by
an excessive tendency to observe, to analyze, or to
criticise, reason, find fault. In order to take the
decisive step and become abnormal one condition
more is necessary&mdash;intensity of the representations.</p>

<p>2. Next, the interchange of place, indicated
above, occurs. Weak states (images) become
strong; strong states (perceptions) become weak.
The impressions from without are powerless to fulfill
their regular function of inhibition. We find
the simplest example of this state in the exceptional
persistence of certain dreams. Ordinarily, our nocturnal
imaginings vanish as empty phantasmagorias
at the inrush of the perceptions and habits of daily
life&mdash;they seem like faraway phantoms, without objective
value. But, in the struggle occurring, on
waking, between images and perceptions, the latter
are not always victorious. There are dreams&mdash;i.e.,
imaginary creations&mdash;that remain firm in face of
reality, and for some time go along parallel with it.
Taine was perhaps the first to see the importance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
of this fact. He reports that his relative, Dr. Baillarger,
having dreamt that one of his friends had
been appointed editor of a journal, announced the
news seriously to several persons, and doubt arose
in his mind only toward the end of the afternoon.
Since then contemporary psychologists have gathered
various observations of this kind.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The emotional
persistence of certain dreams is known. So-and-so,
one of our neighbors, plays in a dream an
odious r&ocirc;le; we may have a feeling of repulsion or
spite toward him persisting throughout the day.
But this triumph of the image, accidental and
ephemeral in normal man, is frequent and stable
in the imaginers of the second class. Many among
them have asserted that this internal world is the
only reality. G&eacute;rard de Nerval "had very early the
conviction that the majority is mistaken, that the
material universe in which it believes, because its
eyes see it and its hands touch it, is nothing but
phantoms and appearances. For him the invisible
world, on the contrary, was the only one not chimerical."
Likewise, Edgar Allan Poe: "The real
things of the world would affect me like visions, and
only so; while the wild ideas of the land of dreams
became in turn not only the feeding ground of my
daily existence but positively the sole and entire
existence itself." Others describe their life as "a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
permanent dream." We could multiply examples.
Aside from the poets and artists, the mystics would
furnish copious examples. Let us take an exaggerated
instance: This permanent dream is, indeed,
only a part of their existence; it is above all active
through its intensity; but, while it lasts, it absorbs
them so completely that they enter the external
world only with a sudden, violent and painful shock.</p>

<p>(3) If the changing of images into strong states
preponderating in consciousness is no longer an
episode but a lasting disposition, then the imaginative
life undergoes a partial systematization that
approaches insanity. Everyone may be "absorbed"
for a moment; the above-mentioned authors are so
frequently. On a higher level this invading supremacy
of the internal life becomes a habit. This third
degree is but the second carried to excess.</p>

<p>Some cases of double personality (those of Azam,
Reynolds) are known in which the second state is at
first embryonic and of short duration; then its
appearances are repeated, its sphere becomes extended.
Little by little it engrosses the greater part
of life; it may even entirely supplant the earlier self.
The growing working of the imagination is similar
to this. Thanks to two causes acting in unison,
temperament and habit, the imaginative and internal
life tends to become systematized and to encroach
more and more on the real, external life. In an
account by F&eacute;r&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> one may follow step by step this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
work of systematization which we abridge here to
its chief characteristics.</p>

<p>The subject, M......, a man thirty-seven years
old, had from childhood a decided taste for solitude.
Seated in an out-of-the-way corner of the house or
out of doors, "he commenced from that time on to
build castles in Spain that little by little took on a
considerable importance in his life. His constructions
were at first ephemeral, replaced every day by
new ones. They became progressively more consistent....
When he had well entered into
his imaginary r&ocirc;le, he often succeeded in continuing
his musing in the presence of other people. At
college, whole hours would be spent in this way;
often he would see and hear nothing." Married, the
head of a prosperous business house, he had some
respite; then he returned to his former constructions.
"They commenced by being, as before, not
very durable or absorbing; but gradually they
acquired more intensity and duration, and lastly
became fixed in a definite form."</p>

<p>"To sum up, here is what this ideal life, lasting
almost from his fourth year, meant: M...... had
built at Chaville, on the outskirts of the forest, an
imaginary summer residence surrounded by a garden.
By successive additions the pavilion became
a ch&acirc;teau; the garden, a park; servants, horses,
water-fixtures came to ornament the domain. The
furnishings of the inside had been modified at the
same time. A wife had come to give life to the
picture; two children had been born. Nothing was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
wanting to this household, only the being true....
One day he was in his imaginary salon at
Chaville, occupied in watching an upholsterer who
was changing the arrangement of the tapestry. He
was so absorbed in the matter that he did not notice
a man coming toward him, and at the question,
'M......, if you please&mdash;?' he answered, without
thinking, 'He is at Chaville.' This reply, given in
public, aroused in him a real terror. 'I believe that
I was foolish,' he said. Coming to himself, he
declared that he was ready to do anything to get rid
of his ideas."</p>

<p>Here the imaginative type is at its maximum, at
the brink of insanity without being over it. Associations
and combinations of images form the entire
content of consciousness, which remains impervious
to impressions from without. Its world becomes
<i>the</i> world. The parasitic life undermines and corrodes
the other in order to become established in its
place&mdash;it grows, its parts adhere more closely, it
forms a compact mass&mdash;the imaginary systematization
is complete.</p>

<p>(4) The fourth stage is an exaggeration of the
foregoing. The <i>completely</i> systematized and permanent
imaginative life excludes the other. This is
the extreme form, the beginning of insanity, which
is outside our subject, from which pathology has
been excluded.</p>

<p>Imagination in the insane would deserve a special
study, that would be lengthy, because there is no
form of imagination that insanity has not adopted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
In no period have insane creations been lacking in
the practical, religious, or mystic life, in poetry, the
fine arts, and in the sciences; in industrial, commercial,
mechanical, military projects, and in plans
for social and political reform. We should, then,
be abundantly supplied with facts.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>It would be difficult, for, if in ordinary life we
are often perplexed to decide whether a man is sane
or not, how much more then, when it is a question
of an inventor, of an act of the creative faculty,
i.e., of a venture into the unknown! How many
innovators have been regarded as insane, or as at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
least unbalanced, visionary! We cannot even invoke
success as a criterion. Many non-viable or abortive
inventions have been fathered by very sane minds,
and people regarded as insane have vindicated their
imaginative constructions through success.</p>

<p>Let us leave these difficulties of a subject that is
not our own, in order to determine merely the
psychological criterion belonging to the fourth stage.</p>

<p>How may we rightly assert that a form of
imaginative life is clearly pathologic? In my opinion,
the answer must be sought in the nature and
degree of belief accompanying the labor of creating.
It is an axiom unchallenged by anyone&mdash;whether
idealist or realist of any shade of belief&mdash;that nothing
has existence for us save through the consciousness
we have of it; but for realism&mdash;and experimental
psychology is of necessity realistic&mdash;there are
two distinct forms of existence.</p>

<p>One, subjective, having no reality except in consciousness,
for the one experiencing it, its reality
being due only to belief, to that first affirmation of
the mind so often described.</p>

<p>The other, objective, existing in consciousness
and outside of it, being real not only for me but
for all those whose constitution is similar or analogous
to mine.</p>

<p>This much borne in mind, let us compare the last
two degrees of the development of the imaginative
life.</p>

<p>For the imaginer of the third stage, the two forms
of existence are not confounded. He distinguishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
<i>two</i> worlds, preferring one and making the best of
the other, but believing in both. He is conscious
of passing from one to the other. There is an
alternation. The observation of F&eacute;r&eacute;, although
extreme, is a proof of this.</p>

<p>At the fourth stage, in the insane, imaginative
labor&mdash;the only kind with which we are concerned&mdash;is
so systematized that the distinction between
the two kinds of existence has disappeared. All the
phantoms of his brain are invested with objective
reality. Occurrences without, even the most extraordinary,
do not reach one in this stage, or else are
interpreted in accordance with the diseased fancy.
There is no longer any alternation.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>By way of summary we may say: The creative
imagination consists of the property that images
have of gathering in new combinations, through the
effect of a spontaneity whose nature we have attempted
to describe. It always tends to realize itself
in degrees that vary from mere momentary belief
to complete objectivity. Throughout its multiple
manifestations, it remains identical with itself in its
basic nature, in its constitutive elements. The
diversity of its deeds depends on the end desired,
the conditions required for its attainment, materials
employed which, as we have seen, under the collective
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>name "representations" are very unlike one
another, not only as regards their sensuous origin
(visual, auditory, tactile, etc.) but also as regards
their psychologic nature (concrete, symbolic, affective,
emotional-abstract images; generic and schematic
images, concepts&mdash;each group itself having
shades or degrees).</p>

<p>This constructive activity, applying itself to everything
and radiating in all directions, is in its early,
typical form a mythic creation. It is an invincible
need of man to reflect and reproduce his own nature
in the world surrounding him. The first application
of his mind is thinking by analogy, which vivifies
everything after the human model and attempts to
know everything according to arbitrary resemblances.
Myth-making activity, which we have
studied in the child and in primitive man, is the
embryonic form whence arise by a slow evolution
religious creations&mdash;gross or refined; esthetic development,
which is a fallen, impoverished mythology;
the fantastic conceptions of the world that may
little by little become scientific conceptions, with,
however, an irreducible residuum of hypotheses.
Alongside of these creations, all bordering upon
what we have called the fixed form, there are practical,
objective creations. As for the latter, we
could not trace them to the same mythic source
except by dialectic subtleties which we renounce.
The former arise from an internal efflorescence; the
latter from urgent life-needs; they appear later and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
are a bifurcation of the early trunk: but the same
sap flows in both branches.</p>

<p>The constructive imagination penetrates every
part of our life, whether individual or collective,
speculative and practical, in all its forms&mdash;<span class="smcap">it is
everywhere</span>.</p>

neurones taken together cannot spontaneously, that is, of themselves,
give rise to any movement&mdash;they receive from without,
and expend their energy outwards. Nevertheless, between the
two moments that, in reflex and instinctive actions, seem continuous,
a third interposes, which, for the higher psychic acts,
may be of long duration. Thus, reasonings in logical form and
reflection regarding a decision to be made have a feeble tendency
to become changed into acts; their motor effects are
indirect, and at a long range. But this intermediate moment
is <i>par excellence</i> the moment for psychology. It is also the
moment of the personal equation: every man receives, transforms,
and restores outwards according to his own organization,
temperament, idiosyncrasies, character&mdash;in a word, according
to his personality, of which needs, tendencies, desires,
are the direct and immediate expression. So we come back, by
another route, to the same definition of spontaneity.</p></div>

(<i>Annales m&eacute;dico-psychologiques</i>, December, 1876), holds
that every kind of mental disease has its own form of imagination
that expresses itself in stories, compositions, sketches,
decorations, dress, and symbolic attributes. The maniac invents
complicated and improbable designs; the persecuted,
symbolic designs, strange writings, bordering on the horrible;
megalomaniacs look for the effect of everything they say and
do; the general paralytic lives in grandeur and attributes
capital importance to everything; lunatics love the na&iuml;ve and
childishly wonderful.
</p><p>
There are also great imaginers who, having passed through
a period of insanity, have strongly regretted it "as a state
in which the soul, more exalted and more refined, perceives
invisible relations and enjoys spectacles that escape the material
eyes." Such was G&eacute;rard de Nerval. As for Charles Lamb, he
would assert that he should be envied the days spent in an
insane asylum. "Sometimes," he said in a letter to Coleridge,
"I cast a longing glance backwards to the condition in which
I found myself; for while it lasted I had many hours of pure
happiness. Do not believe, Coleridge, that you have tasted the
grandeur and all the transport of fancy if you have not been
insane. Everything seems to me now insipid in comparison."

at Charenton, who, during the Franco-Prussian War, despite
the stories that were told them, the papers that they read, and
the shells bursting under the walls of the asylum, maintained
that the war was only imagined, and that all was only a contrivance
of their persecutors.</p></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Various Forms of Inspiration</span><a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></h3>


<p>Among the descriptions of the inspired state
found in various authors, I select only three, which
are brief and have each a special character.</p>

<p>I. Mystic inspiration, in a passive form, in
Jacob Boehme (<i>Aurora</i>): "I declare before God
that I do not myself know how the thing arises
within me, without the participation of my will. I
do not even know that which I must write. If I
write, it is because the Spirit moves me and communicates
to me a great, wonderful knowledge.
Often I do not even know whether I dwell in spirit
in this present world and whether it is I myself that
have the fortune to possess a certain and solid
knowledge."</p>

<p>II. Feverish and painful inspiration in Alfred
de Musset: "Invention annoys me and makes me
tremble. Execution, always too slow for my wish,
makes my heart beat awfully, and weeping, and
keeping myself from crying aloud, I am delivered
of an idea that is intoxicating me, but of which I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
am mortally ashamed and disgusted next morning.
If I change it, it is worse, it deserts me&mdash;it is much
better to forget it and wait for another; but this
other comes to me so confused and misshapen that
my poor being cannot contain it. It presses and
tortures me, until it has taken realizable proportions,
when comes the other pain, of bringing forth,
a truly physical suffering that I cannot define. And
that is how my life is spent when I let myself be
dominated by this artistic monster in me. It is
much better, then, that I should live as I have
imagined living, that I go to all kinds of excess, and
that I kill this never-dying worm that people like
me modestly term their inspiration, but which I
call, plainly, my weakness."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>III. The poet Grillparzer<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> analyzes the condition,
thus:</p>

<p>"Inspiration, properly so called, is the concentration
of all the faculties and aptitudes on a single
point which, for the moment, should include the
rest of the world less than represent it. The
strengthening of the state of the soul comes from
the fact that its various faculties, instead of being
disseminated over the whole world, find themselves
contained within the limits of a single object, touch
one another, reciprocally upholding, re&euml;nforcing,
completing themselves. Thanks to this isolation,
the object emerges out of the average level of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
<i>milieu</i>, is illumined all around and put in relief&mdash;it
takes body, moves, lives. But to attain this is necessary
the concentration of all the faculties. It is only
when the art-work has been a world for the artist

<h3><span class="smcap">On the Nature of the Unconscious Factor</span></h3>


<p>We have seen that in the question of the unconscious
there must be recognized a positive part&mdash;facts,
and an hypothetical part&mdash;theories.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Insofar as the facts are concerned, it would be
well, I think, to establish two categories&mdash;(1) static
unconscious, comprising habits, memory, and, in
general, all that is organized knowledge. It is a
state of preservation, of rest; very relatively, since
representations suffer incessant corrosion and
change. (2) Dynamic unconscious, which is a
state of latent activity, of elaboration and incubation.
We might give a multitude of proofs of this
unconscious rumination. The well-known fact that
an intellectual work gains by being interrupted;
that in resuming it one often finds it cleared up,
changed, even accomplished, was explained by some
psychologists prior to Carpenter by "the resting of
the mind." It would be just as valid to say that a
traveler covers leagues by lying abed. The author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
just mentioned<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> has brought together many observations
in which the solution of a mathematical,
mechanical, commercial problem appeared suddenly
after hours and days of vague, undefinable uneasiness,
the cause of which is unknown, which, however,
is only the result of an underlying cerebral
working; for the trouble, sometimes rising to
anguish, ceases as soon as the unawaited conclusion
has entered consciousness. The men who think the
most are not those who have the clearest and "most
conscious" ideas, but those having at their disposal
a rich fund of unconscious elaboration. On the
other hand, shallow minds have a naturally poor
unconscious fund, capable of but slight development;
they give out immediately and rapidly all that they
are able to give; they have no reserve. It is useless
to allow them time for reflection or invention. They
will not do better; they may do worse.</p>

<p>As to the nature of the unconscious working, we
find disagreement and darkness. One may doubtless
maintain, theoretically, that in the inventor everything
goes on in subconsciousness and in unconsciousness,
just as in consciousness itself, with the
exception that a message does not arrive as far as
the self; that the labor that may be followed, in
clear consciousness, in its progress and retreats,
remains the same when it continues unknown to us.
This is possible. Yet it must at least be recognized
that consciousness is rigorously subject to the condition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>of time, the unconscious is not. This difference,
not to mention others, is not negligible, and
could well arouse other problems.</p>

<p>The contemporary theories regarding the nature
of the unconscious seem to me reducible to two
principal positions&mdash;one psychological, the other
physiological.</p>

<p>1. The physiological theory is simple and
scarcely permits any variations. According to it,
unconscious activity is simply cerebral; it is an
"unconscious cerebration." The psychic factor,
which ordinarily accompanies the activity of the
nervous centers, is absent. Although I incline
toward this hypothesis, I confess that it is full of
difficulties.</p>

<p>It has been proven through numerous experiments
(F&eacute;r&eacute;, Binet, Mosso, Janet, Newbold, etc.) that
"unconscious sensations"<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> act, since they produce
the same reactions as conscious sensations, and
Mosso has been able to maintain that "the testimony
of consciousness is less certain than that of the
sphygmograph." But the particular instance of
invention is very different; for it does not merely
suppose the adaptation to an end which the physiological
factor would suffice to explain; it implies a
series of adaptations, corrections, rational operations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>of which nervous activity alone furnishes us
no example.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>2. The psychological theory is based on an
equivocal use of the word consciousness. Consciousness
has one definite mark&mdash;it is an internal
event existing, not by itself, but for me and insofar
as it is known by me. But the psychological theory
of the unconscious assumes that if we descend from
clear consciousness progressively to obscure consciousness,
to the subconscious, to the unconscious
that manifests itself only through its motor reactions,
the first state thus successively impoverished,
still remains, down to its final term, identical in its
basis with consciousness. It is an hypothesis that
nothing justifies.</p>

<p>No difficulty arises when we bear in mind the
legitimate distinction between consciousness of self
and consciousness in general, the former entirely
subjective, the latter in a way objective (the consciousness
of a man captivated by an attractive
scene; better yet, the fluid form of revery or of the
awaking from syncope). We may admit that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
evanescent consciousness, affective in nature, felt
rather than perceived, is due to a lack of synthesis,
of relations among the internal states, which remain
isolated, unable to unite into a whole.</p>

<p>The difficulty commences when we descend into
the region of the subconscious, which allows stages
whose obscurity increases in proportion as we move
away from clear consciousness, "like a lake in which
the action of light is always nearing extinction" (in
double coexisting personalities, automatic writing,
mediums, etc.). Here some postulate two currents
of consciousness existing at the same time in one
person without reciprocal connection. Others suppose
a "field of consciousness" with a brilliant center
and extending indefinitely toward the dim distance.
Still others liken the phenomenon to the movement
of waves, whose summit alone is lighted up. Indeed,
the authors declare that with these comparisons
and metaphors they make no pretense of
explaining; but certainly they all reduce unconsciousness
to consciousness, as a special to a general
case, and what is that if not explaining?</p>

<p>I do not intend to enumerate all the varieties of
the psychological theory. The most systematic, that
of Myers, accepted by Delboef and others, is full of
a biological mysticism all its own. Here it is in
substance: In every one of us there is a conscious
self adapted to the needs of life, and potential selves
constituting the subliminal consciousness. The latter,
much broader in scope than personal consciousness,
has dependent on it the entire vegetative life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>&mdash;circulation,
trophic actions, etc. Ordinarily the conscious
self is on the highest level, the subliminal
consciousness on the second; but in certain extraordinary
states (hypnosis, hysteria, divided consciousness,
etc.) it is just the reverse. Here is the
bold part of the hypothesis: Its authors suppose
that the supremacy of the subliminal consciousness
is a reversion, a return to the ancestral. In the
higher animals and in primitive man, according to
them, all trophic actions entered consciousness and
were regulated by it. In the course of evolution this
became organized; the higher consciousness has
delegated to the subliminal consciousness the care
of silently governing the vegetative life. But in
case of mental disintegration there occurs a return
to the primitive state. In this manner they explain
burns through suggestion, stigmata, trophic changes
of a miraculous appearance, etc. It is needless to
dwell on this conception of the unconscious. It has
been vehemently criticised, notably by Bramwell,
who remarks that if certain faculties could little by
little fall into the domain of subliminal consciousness
because they were no longer necessary for the
struggle for life, there are nevertheless faculties so
essential to the well-being of the individual that we
ask ourselves how they have been able to escape
from the control of the will. If, for example, some
lower type had the power of arresting pain, how
could it lose it?</p>

<p>At the foundation of the psychological theory in
all its forms is the unexpressed hypothesis that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
consciousness may be likened to a quantity that
forever decreases without reaching zero. This is a
postulate that nothing justifies. The experiments
of psychophysicists, without solving the question,
would support rather the opposite view. We know
that the "threshold of consciousness" or minimum
perceptible quantity, appears and disappears suddenly;
the excitation is not felt under a determinate
limit. Likewise in regard to the "summit of perception"
or maximum perceptible, any increase of
excitation is no longer felt if above a determinate
limit. Moreover, in order that an increase or
diminution be felt between these two extreme limits,
it is necessary that both have a constant relation&mdash;differential
threshold&mdash;as is expressed in Weber's
law. All these facts, and others that I omit, are not
favorable to the thesis of growing or diminishing
continuity of consciousness. It has even been maintained
that consciousness "has an aversion for continuity."</p>

<p>To sum up: The two rival theories are equally
unable to penetrate into the inner nature of the
unconscious factor. We have thus had to limit
ourselves to taking it as a fact of experience and to
assign it its place in the complex function that
produces invention.</p>

<p>The observations of Flournoy (in his book, mentioned
above, Part I, <a href="#Page_50">chapter III</a>) have a particular
interest in relation to our subject. His medium,
Hel&egrave;ne S......&mdash;very unlike others, who are satisfied
with forecasts of the future, disclosures of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
unknown past events, counsel, prognosis, evocation,
etc., without creating anything, in the proper sense&mdash;is
the author of three or four novels, one of
which, at least, is invented out of whole cloth&mdash;revelations
in regard to the planet Mars, its countries,
inhabitants, dwellings, etc. Although the
descriptions and pictures of Hel&egrave;ne S. are found
on comparison to be borrowed from our terrestrial
globe, and transposed and changed, as Flournoy has
well shown, it is certain that in this "Martian
novel," to say nothing of the others, there is a
richness of invention that is rare among mediums:
the creative imagination in its subliminal (unconscious)
form encloses the other in its &eacute;clat. We
know how much the cases of mediums teach us in
regard to the unconscious life of the mind. Here
we are permitted, as an exceptional case, to penetrate
into the dark laboratory of romantic invention,
and we can appreciate the importance of the labor
that is going on there.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cosmic and Human Imagination</span><a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></h3>


<p>For Froschammer, <i>Fancy</i> is the original principle
of things. In his philosophical theory it plays
the same part as Hegel's <i>Idea</i>, Schopenhauer's <i>Will</i>,
Hartmann's <i>Unconscious</i>, etc. It is, at first, objective&mdash;in
the beginning the universal creative power
is immanent in things, just as there is contained in
the kernel the principle that shall give the plant its
form and construct its organism; it spreads out into
the myriads of vegetable and animal existences that
have been succeeded or that still live on the surface
of the Cosmos. The first organized beings must
have been very simple; but little by little the objective
imagination increases its energy by exercising
it; it invents and realizes increasingly more complex
images that attest the progress of its artistic genius.
So Darwin was right in asserting that a slow evolution
raises up organized beings towards fulness of
life and beauty of form.</p>

<p>Step by step, it succeeds in becoming conscious
of itself in the mind of man&mdash;it becomes subjective.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Generative power, at first diffused throughout the
organism, becomes localized in the generative
organs, and becomes established in sex. "The brain,
in living beings, may form a pole opposed to the
reproductive organs, especially when these beings
are very high in the organic scale." Thus changed,
the generative power has become capable of perceiving
new relations, of bringing forth internal worlds.
In nature and in man it is the same principle that
causes living forms to appear&mdash;objective images in a
way, and subjective images, a kind of living forms
that arise and die in the mind.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>This metaphysical theory, one of the many varieties
of <i>mens agitat molem</i>, being, like every other, a
personal conception, it is superfluous to discuss or
criticise its evident anthropomorphism. But, since
we are dealing with hypotheses, I venture to risk a
comparison between embryological development in
physiology, instinct in psychophysiology, and the
creative imagination in psychology. These three
phenomena are creations, i.e., a disposition of certain
materials following a determinate type.</p>

<p>In the first case, the ovum after fertilization is
subject to a rigorously determined evolution whence
arises such and such an individual with its specific
and personal characters, its hereditary influences,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
etc. Every disturbing factor in this evolution produces
deviations, monstrosities, and the creation
does not attain the normal. Embryology can follow
these changes step by step. There remains one
obscure point in any event, and that is, the nature
of what the ancients called the <i>nisus formativus</i>.</p>

<p>In the case of instinct, the initial moment is an
external or internal sensation, or rather, a representation&mdash;the
image of a nest to be built, in the case
of the bird; of a tunnel to be dug, for the ant; of a
comb to be made, for the bee and the wasp; of a
web to be spun, for the spider, etc. This initial
state puts into action a mechanism determined by the
nature of each species, and ends in creations of
special kinds. However, variations of instinct, its
adaptation to various conditions, show that the conditions
of the determinism are less simple, that the
creative activity is endowed with a certain plasticity.</p>

<p>In the third case, creative imagination, the ideal,
a sketched construction, is the equivalent of the
ovum; but it is evident that the plasticity of the
creative imagination is much greater than that of
instinct. The imagination may radiate in several
very different ways, and the plan of the invention,
as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> may arise as a whole and develop
regularly in an embryological manner, or else present
itself in a fragmentary, partial form that becomes
complete after a series of attractions.</p>

<p>Perhaps an identical process, forming three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
stages&mdash;a lower, middle, and higher&mdash;is at the root
of all three cases. But this is only a speculative
hypothesis, foreign to psychology proper.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Evidence in Regard to Musical Imagination</span><a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></h3>


<p>The question asked above,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Does the experiencing
of purely musical sounds evoke images, universally,
and of what nature and under what conditions?
seemed to me to enter a more general field&mdash;the
affective imagination&mdash;which I intend to study elsewhere
in a special work. For the time being I limit
myself to observations and information that I have
gathered, picking from them several that I give here
for the sake of shedding light on the question. I
give first the replies of musicians; then, those of
non-musicians.</p>

<p>1. M. Lionel Dauriac writes me: "The question
that you ask me is complex. I am not a 'visualizer;'
I have infrequent hypnagogic hallucinations,
and they are all of the auditory type.</p>

<p>"... Symphonic music aroused in me no
image of the visual type while I remained the
amateur that you knew from 1876 to 1898. When
that amateur began to reflect methodically on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
art of his taste, he recognized in music a power of
suggesting:</p>

<p>"1. Sonorous, non-musical images&mdash;thunder,
clock. Example, the overture of <i>William Tell</i>.</p>

<p>"2. Psychic images&mdash;suggestion of a mental
state&mdash;anger, love, religious feeling.</p>

<p>"3. Visual images, whether following upon the
psychic image or through the intermediation of a
programme.</p>

<p>"Under what condition, in a symphonic work, is
the visual image, introduced by the psychic image,
produced? In the event of a break in the melodic
web (see my <i>Psychologie dans l'Op&eacute;ra</i>, pp. 119-120).
Here are given, without orderly arrangement,
some of the ideas that have come to me:</p>

<p>"Beethoven's <i>symphony in C major</i> appears to me
purely musical&mdash;it is of a sonorous design. The
<i>symphony in D major</i> (the second) suggests to me
visual-motor images&mdash;I set a ballet to the first part
and keep track altogether of the ballet that I picture.
The <i>Heroic Symphony</i> (aside from the funeral
march, the meaning of which is indicated in the
title) suggests to me images of a military character,
ever since the time that I noticed that the fundamental
theme of the first portion is based on notes
of perfect harmony&mdash;trumpet-notes and, by association,
military. The <i>finale</i> of this symphony, which
I consider superior to other parts, does not cause me
to see anything. <i>Symphony in B flat major</i>&mdash;I see
nothing there&mdash;this may be said without qualification.
<i>Symphony in C minor</i>&mdash;it is dramatic, although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>the melodic web is never broken. The first
part suggests the image, not of Fate knocking at
the gate, as Beethoven said, but of a soul overcome
with the crises of revolt, accompanied by a hope of
victory. Visual images do not come except as
brought by psychic images."</p>

<p>F. G., a musician, always sees&mdash;that is the rule,
notably in the <i>Pastoral</i>, and in the <i>Heroic Symphony</i>.
In Bach's <i>Passion</i> he beholds the scene of
the mystic lamb.</p>

<p>A composer writes me: "When I compose or
play music of my own composition I behold dancing
figures; I see an orchestra, an audience, etc. When
I listen to or play music by another composer I do
not see anything." This communication also mentions
three other musicians who see nothing.</p>

<p>2. D......, so little of a musician that I had
some trouble to make him understand the term
"symphonic music," never goes to concerts. However,
he went once, fifteen years ago, and there remains
in his memory very clearly the principal
phrase of a minuet (he hums it)&mdash;he cannot recall
it without seeing people dancing a minuet.</p>

<p>M. O. L...... has been kind enough to question
in my behalf sixteen non-musical persons. Here
are the results of his inquiry:</p>

<p>Eight see curved lines.</p>

<p>Three see images, figures springing in the air,
fantastic designs.</p>

<p>Two see the waves of the ocean.</p>

<p>Three do not see anything.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Imaginative Type and Association of Ideas</span><a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></h3>


<p>I have questioned a very great number of imaginative
persons, well known to me as such, and have
chosen preferably those who, not making a profession
of creating, let their fancy wander as it wills,
without professional care. In all the mechanism is
the same, differing scarcely more than temperament
and degree of culture. Here are two examples.</p>

<p>B......, forty-six years of age, is acquainted
with a large part of Europe, North America,
Oceania, Hindoostan, Indo-China, and North
Africa, and has not passed through these countries
on the run, but, because of his duties, resided there
some time. It is worthy of remark, as will be seen
from the following observation, that the remembrance
of such various countries does not have first
place in this brilliant, fanciful personage&mdash;which
fact is an argument in favor of the very personal
character of the creative imagination.</p>

<p>"In a general way, imagination, very lively in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
me, functions by association of ideas. Memory or
the outer world furnishes me some data. On this
data there is not always, though there should be,
imaginative work proper, and then things remain
as they are, without end.</p>

<p>"But when I meet a construction&mdash;it matters little
whether ancient or in the course of erection&mdash;the
formula, 'That ought to be fixed,' is one that rises
mechanically to my mind in such a case; often it
happens that I think aloud and say it, although
alone. When going away from the architectural
subject<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> under consideration, I make up infinite
variations upon it, one after another. Sometimes
the things start from a reflex...."</p>

<p>After having noted his preference for the architecture
of the Middle Ages, B...... adds (here he
touches on the unconscious factor):</p>

<p>"Were I to explain or attempt to explain how the
Middle Ages have such an attraction for my mind,
I should see therein an atavistic accumulation of
religious feeling fixed in my family, on the female
side no doubt, and of religiousness in ecclesiastical
architecture&mdash;these touch.</p>

<p>"Another example illustrating the r&ocirc;le of association
of ideas in the same matter. One Sunday
night I left Noumea in the carriage of Dr. F......
who was going to visit a nunnery five leagues from
there. At the moment of our arrival the doctor
asked what time it was. 'Half-past two,' I said,
looking at my watch. As we stopped in the convent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span> court
in front of the chapel I <i>heard</i> the lusty conclusion
of a psalm. 'They are singing vespers,' I
remarked to the doctor. He commenced to laugh.
'What time are vespers sung in your town?' 'At
half-past two,' I answered. I opened the chapel
door in order to show the doctor that vespers had
just been held: the chapel was vacant. As I stood
there, somewhat non-plussed, the doctor remarked,
'Cerebral automatism.'</p>

<p>"I may add here, <i>by association</i> of ideas. The
doctor had seen through me, and had with fine
insight perceived <i>why</i> I had <i>heard</i> the end of the
psalm. The incident made a great impression on
me, all the more as ever since the age of eight my
memory testifies to a like hallucination, but of sight
in place of hearing. It was at L...... that on
Good Friday they rang at the cathedral with all
their might. It was the very moment before the
bells remain silent for three days, and it is known
that this silence, ordained in the liturgy, is explained
to children by telling them that during these
two days the bells have flown to Rome. Naturally
I was treated to this little tale, and as they finished
telling it, I <i>saw</i> a bell flying at an angle that I
could still describe.</p>

<p>"But this transforming power of my imagination
is not present in me to the same extent as regards
all things. It is much more operative in relation to
Romano-Gothic architecture, mystic literature, and
sociological knowledge than in relation, for instance,
to my memories of travels. When I see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
again, in the mind's eye, the Isle of Bourbon,
Niagara, Tahiti, Calcutta, Melbourne, the Pyramids
and the Sphinx, the graphic representation is intellectually
perfect. The objects live again in all their
external surroundings. I feel the <i>Khamsinn</i>, the
desert wind that scorched me at the foot of Pompey's
Column; I hear the sea breaking into foam on
the barrier reef of Tahiti. But the image does not
lead to evocation of related or parallel ideas.</p>

<p>"When, on the other hand, I take a walk over
the Comburg moor, the castle weighs upon me in all
its massiveness; the recollections of the <i>M&eacute;moires
d'Outre-tombe</i> besiege me like living pictures. I
see, like Chateaubriand himself, the family of great
famished lords in their feudal castle. With Chateaubriand
I return in the twinkling of an eye to the
Niagara that we have both seen. In the fall of the
waters I find the deep and melancholy note that he
himself found; and after that I think of that dark
cathedral of Dol that evidently suggested to the
author his <i>G&eacute;nie du Christianisme</i>.</p>

<p>"In literature, things are very unequally suggestive
to me. Classic literature has only few paths
outwards for me&mdash;Tacitus, Lucretius, Juvenal,
Homer, and Saint-Simon excepted. I read the
other authors of this class partly for themselves,
without making a comparison. On the other hand,
the reading of Dante, Shakespeare, St. Jerome's
compact verses on the Hebrew, and Middle Age
prose excites within me a whole world of ideas, like
Wagner's music, <i>canto-fermo</i>, and Beethoven. Certain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>things form a link for me from one order of
ideas to another. For example, Michaelangelo and
the Bible, Rembrandt and Balzac, Puvis de Chavannes
and the Merovingian narratives.</p>

<p>"To sum up: There are in me certain <i>milieux</i>
especially favorable to imagination. When any circumstance
brings me into one of them, it is rare that
an imaginative network does not occur; and, if one
is produced, association of ideas will perform the
work. When I give myself up to serious work, I
have to mistrust myself: and in this connection I
shall surprise people when I say that in the class of
ideas above indicated the subject exciting the most
ideas in me is sociology."</p>

<p>M......, sixty years of age, artistic temperament.
Because of the necessities of life, he has
followed a profession entirely opposite to his bent.
He has given me his "confession" in the form of
fragmentary notes made day by day. Many are
<i>moral</i> remarks on the subject of his imagination&mdash;I
leave them out. I note especially the unconquerable
tendency to make up little romances and some
details in regard to visual representation, and a
dislike for numbers.</p>

<p>"It happens that I experience sharp regret when I
see the photograph of a monument, e.g., the Pantheon,
the proportions of which I have constructed
according to the descriptions of the monument and
the idea that I had of the life of the Greeks. The
photograph mars my dream.</p>

<p>"From the seen to the unknown. In the S. G.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
library. A slender young woman, smartly dressed&mdash;spotless
black gloves&mdash;between her fingers a small
pencil and a tiny note-book. What business has this
affectation this morning in a classic and dull building,
in a common environment of poor workmen?
She is not a servant-maid, and not a teacher. Now
for the solution of the unknown. I follow the
woman to her family, into her home, and it is quite
a task.</p>

<p>"In the same library. I want to get an address
from the <i>Almanach Bottin</i>. A young man, perhaps
a student, has borrowed the ridiculous volume.
Bent over it, his hands in his hair, he turns the
leaves with the sage leisure of a scholar looking for
a commentary. From the empty dictionary he often
draws out a letter. He must have received this
letter this morning from the country. His family
advises him to apply to so-and-so. It is a question
of money and employment. He must locate the
people who, provincial ignorance said, are near him.
And so goes the wandering imagination.</p>

<p>"When I feel myself drawn to anyone, I prefer
seeing images or portraits rather than the reality.
That is how I avoid making unforeseen discoveries
that would spoil my model.</p>

<p>"If I make numerical calculations, in the absence
of concrete factors, the imagination goes afield, and
the figures group themselves mechanically, harkening
to an inner voice that arranges them in order to
get the sense.</p>

<p>"There may be an imagination devoted to arithmetical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>calculations&mdash;forms, beings intrude, even
the outline of the figure 3, for example; and then
the addition or any other calculation is ruined.</p>

<p>"I revert to the impossibility of making an addition
without a swerve of imagination, because
plastic figures are always ready before the calculator.
The man of imagination is always constructing
by means of plastic images.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Life possesses
him, intoxicates him, so he never gets tired."</p>
